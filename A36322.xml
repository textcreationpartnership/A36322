            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Her Death was the Occaſion of this enſuing Diſcourſe; firſt ſtudied for my own uſe, when my deſign was to labour after, till I had attained theſe two things, <hi>A lively ſenſe of Gods afflicting Hand in the Death of one ſo dear, and a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs of Mind, patiently ſubmitting to his Wiſe, Righteous and Holy Will:</hi> next preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:66385:3"/> to you; and becauſe Death will alſo part you and yours, now preſented to your view, for the Comfort, Guidance and Support of thoſe that ſhall be the ſorrowful Survivors.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of its delay ſo long, was the holy Hand of God in Afflicting me with my uſual pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſtemper ſhortly after her Deceaſe, which made interruptions in the preaching of it to you; in which Sickneſs, I thank you for the concerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Spirits for me, and the Prayers I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you put up to God in your Families for me, and when I heard it was your deſign to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among your ſelves to spend ſome time in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon my account, it was no ſmall refreſhment to me in mine Affliction; and when I deſired it might be where I might have the benefit of hearing and joyning with you, you readily conſented. The next Lords day following, God healing of me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expectations of any (except ſome few that viſited me on Saturday) brought me to my publick Work amongſt you, which I hope you will take notice of as an Encouragement to pray on a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Occaſions, ſince this (late) Experience you have had, that God ſuffers not the Seed of <hi>Jacob to ſeek his Face</hi> and Favour in vain, but is ſo ready to return anſwers to a praying People.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe that thus did meet, ſome were ſuch as were Catethized by me twenty years ſince, whom now God hath made Maſters of Families, Religiouſly maintaining the holy Worſhip of God dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your Houſes, and have often ſaid to me, you
<pb facs="tcp:66385:3"/> ſtill bleſs God for the good you got then, and for the foundation thereby was laid, on which you ſtill continue to build.</p>
            <p>And tho there are now above fifty Youths, and Young Men, that twice every Lords-day (uſually) preſent themſelves as Catechumens, yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ignorance of many Married and Ancient People, I lately preached and urged ſuch with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arguments to get into their Memories the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, as the nearest and eaſieſt way that I can think of to help them to the Knowledge of the firſt Principles of Chriſtian Religion, which (alas!) they are yet unaccquainted with, and offered them my Aſſiſtance by private Inſtructions (at firſt) to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they ſhould this way commit to memory.</p>
            <p>The effect it then had, brought above fifty Perſons from <hi>24</hi> to <hi>70</hi> years of Age to receive Catechiſms from my hand, making a promiſe one by one, that they would learn them, and come to me to explain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am ſenſible I have but a little time to carry with you; in my Grave, whither I am going, I can neither Preach nor Catechize, nor do any thing for my ſelf, or you, the daily Thoughts whereof are

Oh that you might hear as thoſe that ſtand upon the brink of the Grave, and borders of another Eternal World, not knowing which of you might paſs out of Time into an everlaſting State, before you might have an opportunity to hear again! that you and I might mind and practiſe what is preached and heard, according to Gods Word. With bluſhing I do acknowledge my inability for ſuch gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For this I beſeech you, that you would conſtantly and importunately pray, yea ſtrive and labour in your Prayers that out of our Aſſembly (as well as others) ſome might be daily added to the Church, that might at death be of the Church triumphant, and therein ſing eternal Praiſes to their glorious God, powerful Redeemer and Sanctifier, for which alſo my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall be added to yours, who am</p>

               <p>THe Survivor (according to his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) by ſympathizing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, will be allowed to unload his burthened heart, by pouring out his Complaints in ſome ſuch manner:</p>
               <p>Hath God afflicted me? Hath he chaſtiſed my Children? both <hi>me and them</hi> with ſuch a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66385:6"/> ſmarting Rod, as <hi>Death</hi> bereaving <hi>me</hi> of the choiceſt outward Comfort of my Life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving out of the World from <hi>them</hi> a tender Mother, that brought them into it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cauſed us all to drink deeply of the Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> and filled our Eyes with overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tears, and our Hearts with over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sorrow, and <hi>is it not time</hi> to caſt about what Remedy Scripture doth yield, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot afford? Do I ſtand before you this day in ſuch Circumſtances, as in Preaching for the ſpace of almoſt forty years, I never did, and may I not borrow from you ſome hours in your hearing to ſpeak to <hi>my ſelf and them,</hi> deprived of ſo great a Mercy? <hi>Paul</hi> was in a great ſtrait whether he ſhould chuſe to live or dye; and I am in a ſtrait how I ſhould <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin</hi> Sorrow for <hi>my dead.</hi> For if <hi>defect</hi> of Senſe and Sorrow in this caſe be a Sin, I will ſtrive to Sorrow, that through ſtupidity I might not Sin. If <hi>regular Sorrow</hi> be my duty, I will ſtudy and pray that it might be ſo regulated, that whileſt I Sorrow and not Sin, I might pleaſe and delight my ſelf in this Sorrow, and take ſome comfort from my Sorrow: If <hi>exceſs</hi> be my weakneſs, without Divine Aſſiſtance I cannot remove it, therefore bent my mind to muſe upon theſe words, <hi>I would not have you to be ignorant, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not even as others which have no hope.</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66385:6"/>
               <p>But may not that which is my Sorrow to day, be ſome of yours to morrow? Or within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time <hi>will it</hi> not, <hi>muſt it</hi> not be done to you and yours, which at the preſent is done to me and mine? Are not your Relations mortal as well as ours was? And if <hi>you</hi> have not ſinned <hi>ſo much as we,</hi> yet have not you <hi>ſo much</hi> Sin, as might call Death into your Houſes? Will not Death ſhortly knock at your doors, and enquire <hi>who lives here,</hi> upon this deſign that <hi>there they may die?</hi> Will it not break through your ſtrongeſt Gates, ſcale your higheſt Walls, climbe up to your Windows, enter into your Chambers, come into your very Beds, and take the Wife out of your Boſome, and the ſucking Child from the Mothers Breſt? Will it not in a few Days and Nights more, tear and rend from you the deſire of your Eyes, tho you would hold them faſt in your Arms? Shall not the ſhriekings be heard in your Houſes, as lately were in mine, and the doleful cry go round; while one Child begins, ſaying, <hi>My Mother, alas, my dear Mother is dead!</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall eccho to the voice of the former, with weeping Eyes, with wringing of Hands, and bitterneſs of Soul, ſhall ſay, What ſhall I do? what ſhall I do? <hi>My tender, loving Mother is dead!</hi> my Mother is dead! I could never ſay ſo before, and the firſt time it is ſaid, it is a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful ſaying. May Sin invite Death into your Families, ſaying, <hi>Come in thou Meſſenger
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66385:7"/> of the Lord, come in;</hi> here is one deſerves to dye, and there is another, ſeize him, and hale him out, apprehend him, and take him away; <hi>he lives not as he ſhould, let him die as he ought.</hi> May it ſhortly be ſaid by you, <hi>my Wife is dead, my Husband is dead;</hi> and is Grace and Nature in you ſo equally poized, and have you ſuch a juſt temperament and mixture of both, as not to ſorrow <hi>leſs or more</hi> than you ought; that <hi>now</hi> your Relations are round about your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and no ones place is empty; you might not at preſent hear, for time ſo ſhortly to come, what might be ſaid concerning Sorrow for the dead, and cure your ignorance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them which are aſleep; <hi>that you ſorrow not as others which have no hope:</hi> or tho they dye, yet you ſorrow not, as ſuch do not, that have <hi>neither Faith, nor Hope, nor natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nature and Religion binding me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the temporal and ſpiritual Good of ſo near a Relation all a long, preſſed more hard upon me to give my utmoſt diligence to aſſiſt her in her laſt Sickneſs by Night and Day, by Prayer and Diſcourſe, that ſhe might (and God through his rich Grace and Mercy in Chriſt to her Soul did enable her) with <hi>abiding comfort,</hi> and <hi>ſetled hope</hi> of Heaven, look Death in the face, overcome this <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Terrors,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Fears thereof, when Death by <hi>its ſtroke without a Sting</hi> did conquer her.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66385:7"/>
               <p>This Portion of Scripture from the Text to the end of this Chapter was the <hi>last</hi> I read and urged, before ſhe left her own to go to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, which I do make the <hi>firſt</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and apply in this place for my own and your ſake: Wherein are three generals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Doctrinal Concluſion</hi> concerning Sorrow for ſuch as ſleep in Jeſus, or dye in the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Confirmation of it,</hi> by many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Reaſons, and are helps againſt ſinful Sorrow by exceſs; from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Application of this Doctrine ſo confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or the uſe of Comfort to be made of it againſt ſuch Sorrows, V. 18. <hi>Wherefore comfort one another with theſe words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctrinal Concluſion laid down in the Text, conſiſts of theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>familiar Repreſentation of Death,</hi> that the thoughts of it might be more eaſy to our minds; <hi>to dye,</hi> ſounds more harſh; <hi>to ſleep,</hi> is a ſofter expreſſion of Death. <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Grave</hi> you would every day avoid; <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Bed,</hi> you every night deſire; yet Death is but as a Sleep, and the Grave is but as a Bed; and both ſo called in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66385:8"/>2. The Deportment and Behaviour of the Survivers, in reference to ſuch as ſleep the ſleep of Death, which relates unto their <hi>Sorrow upon this occaſion.</hi> And in this, theſe two things are couched in the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Sorrow ſuppoſed, granted, and allowed to the living for their dead.</hi> For ſhould the living be as ſenſeleſs as the dead, when <hi>Death</hi> hath taken away Life, and Breath, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, ſhall <hi>Sin</hi> take away all work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of natural Affections from us? Shall <hi>Death</hi> ſnatch them out of our Boſoms, force them out of our Arms, and tear one piece of our ſelves from our ſelves, take the one half away, and leave the other behind, and we ſtand and look on without a Tear in our Eyes, without Sorrow in our Hearts, as if we had neither ſenſe of Gods heavy Hand, nor love to them, nor feeling of the ſtroke that thereby is laid upon our ſelves? Sorrow we may, tho not as others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exceſs of Sorrow is corrected.</hi> Lay not the Reins looſe upon your Affections, leſt they carry you to Sin in your Sorrow. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh not thoſe Tears in waſhing your dead, which ſhould be kept for lamenting of your Sins. Let there be a difference betwixt your Sorrow, and the Sorrow of others, as there ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> betwixt thoſe that have hope, and thoſe that have no hope of a joyful Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66385:8"/> to Eternal, Glorious Life. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have no ſuch hope, for they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, the cauſe of hope; without the Church, the place of hope; without the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the ground and reaſon of hope: While you are allowed to mourn <hi>as Men,</hi> do not exceed the bounds and limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>Chriſtian Men.</hi> The Heathens mourn for their dead beyond all bounds of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, while they lament them <hi>as ſuch</hi> that ſhall live no more. But let Chriſtians limit their Sorrow, as <hi>for ſuch,</hi> that tho they be dead, ſhall live again, and after that ſhall die no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Text, is the <hi>Cauſe of exceſſive Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> for the dead, that is, Ignorance concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State of the Dead, now and hereafter, at the preſent and for ever, both as to Body and to Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>cure of exceſſive Sorrow.</hi> Knowledg, Meditation, and firm belief of the preſent and future State of thoſe that dye in the Lord. <hi>I would not have you to be ignorant;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, and therefore mourn to exceſs; but I would not have you ſo to be, that you may not ſorrow as they do. Did ye <hi>know, think, and believe,</hi> that their <hi>Death</hi> is but a <hi>Sleep,</hi> out of which they ſhall certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake; their <hi>Graves,</hi> their <hi>Beds,</hi> out of which, when the morning of the Reſurrection ſhall come, they ſhall ariſe, and that their Souls in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66385:9"/> the mean time are with God, and Chriſt, and the Eternal Spirit, admitted into that glorious Society of Angels and Saints above, perfectly Loving, conſtantly delighting, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually Praiſing and Triumphing in that God that did chuſe them, in that Jeſus that did redeem them with his Blood, in that Holy Spirit that made them meet to be partakers of that Inheritance of <hi>yonder</hi> Saints in Light, and Life, and Love; would you groan while they rejoyce? Would you mourn while they ſing Songs of Praiſe? Are you grieved becauſe they are exalted? Do you take on, as if they were for ever loſt, when by ſaving Mercy they are now for ever found in the glorious Preſence of their Lord, and Father, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer? Could you hear them ſpeak to you, they would ſay, you are in daily Trouble, we in everlaſting Reſt, and Peace, and Triumph; you are in the Field, we have got the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; you are in danger of Sin and Satan, we are freed from them for ever; your love unto our Lord and yours, is imperfect love, while ours wanteth no degree; you know not what we do know of God, and Chriſt, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; you ſee not what we do ſee, nor enjoy ſo much as we enjoy, therefore ſpend your Tears upon your ſelves, and not for us; weep for your ſelves, and not for us; lament your ſelves being yet in a ſinful World, and not us that are lodged in a pure, ſpotleſs Place
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66385:9"/> and Kingdom. You pray, and wait, and hope to be where we are, but we have no deſire to be where you be. We have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Houſe than you live in, better Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and better Work, and ſweeter Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore Sorrow for your ſelves, and not for us.</p>
               <p>But Earth is a place for Sorrow, which we muſt taſt in handling the firſt Doctrine; and after we have pleaſed our ſelves with it, from love to them, we will endeavour and ſeek for Comfort as to them in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) This ſorrow is uſed to expreſs degrees of ſorrow for the afflicted Church. Should not we mourn for the Miſeries of the Church, for the Calamities of the beſt Men? Should we not grieve and ſorrow, when the Sword of an Enemy, and fear is round about us? When the Spoiler comes upon us? And ſhould not the degree of our <hi>ſorrow</hi> be equal to the degrees of the <hi>evil</hi> that befalls us? What are thoſe degrees? Such as are equal to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſorrow of <hi>Parents</hi> for the death of an only Son: When the Spirit of God chuſeth out <hi>ſuch ſorrow</hi> for a pattern of ſorrow for the Church in great diſtreſs, doth it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that ſuch ſorrow for Children removed by death is great ſorrow? <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.25. <hi>The ſword of the enemy, and fear is on every ſide.</hi> 26. <hi>O daughter of my people, gird thee with ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and wallow thy ſelf in aſhes: make thee mourning as for an only ſon, moſt bitter lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66385:13"/> for the ſpoiler ſhall ſuddenly come upon thee:</hi> Let Parents that are little affected with the death of a Child, inquire where are their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affections,</hi> their ſenſe and feeling of the Hand of God in ſo ſevere a blow, when God himſelf ranks <hi>girding with ſackcloth, wallowing in aſhes, bitter lamentations, and mourning for an only Son,</hi> as equalizing each other in degrees of ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) To ſet forth the degrees of ſorrow under ſore and heavy Judgments. <hi>When God threatneth to bring ſuch ſore and heavy Judgments that ſhall cauſe Mens Mirth to ceaſe, their Joy to be baniſhed, their Sorrow to be multiplied; he compares it to the mourning for an only Son;</hi> as what uſeth to be in higheſt degree. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.10. <hi>And I will turn your feaſts into mourning, and all your ſongs into lamentation, and I will bring up ſackcloth upon all loins, and baldneſs upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only ſon, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The degrees of ſorrow of convinced, repenting Sinners. <hi>This manner of mourning is uſed</hi> to ſet forth the <hi>great degrees of ſorrow</hi> that the repenting <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have, when they ſhould be convinced of their Barbarous and Bloody Fact in Murdering of the Son of God. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>And I will pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the ſpirit of grace, and of ſupplications, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66385:14"/> they ſhall mourn for him,</hi> How much? <hi>As one mourneth for his only ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</hi> All theſe ſhew not only <hi>what ſorrow</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, but <hi>what degree</hi> alſo is required, and hath been in Parents for the death of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that have had a due ſenſe of God's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Hand in taking their Children from them by death; Even ſorrow ſetting forth, (1.) The ſorrow for the Calamities of the Church. (2.) The greatneſs of the ſorrow Men are filled with when God's heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are upon them. (3.) The ſorrow of true Penitents for their ſinful carriage to God's own Son. Though the parallel will not hold in all reſpects, yet the greatneſs of the ſorrow of the one is made uſe of to declare the greatneſs of the others; which is ſufficient evidence that ſuch ſorrow is great in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Though Love doth deſcend from Parents to Children, more than it doth aſcend from Children to Parents, yet Children the more dutiful they were to their Living Parents, the more they mourned for them when remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them by Death. (1.) <hi>For their Father.</hi> So <hi>Joſeph</hi> with the reſt of his Brethren for <hi>Jacob. Gen.</hi> 49.33. <hi>When Jacob had made an end of commanding his ſons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghoſt, and was gathered to his people.</hi> Gen. 50.1. <hi>And Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66385:14"/> and kiſſed him.</hi> 7. <hi>Joſeph went up to bury his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 8. <hi>And all the houſe of Joſeph, and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and his fathers houſe.</hi> 10. <hi>And they came to the threſhing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and there they mourned with a very great, and very ſore lamentation: and he made a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his father ſeven days.</hi> 11. <hi>The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the place when they ſaw the mourning, ſaid, this is a very grievous mourning.</hi> (2.) <hi>The Death of Mothers</hi> hath been no leſs lamented by their Children. <hi>Iſaac</hi> mourned for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.67. When <hi>David</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the greatneſs of his ſorrow for others, he aggravates it by this, <hi>I was bowed down as one that mourneth for his mother,</hi> Pſal. 35.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When breaches have been made by Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Brethren and Siſters, the Surviving have greatly ſorrowed for thoſe that were removed from them. Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> lamented the death of their Brother <hi>Lazarus.</hi> John 11.19. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.</hi> 31. <hi>The Jews which were with her in the houſe, and comforted her, when they ſaw Mary, that ſhe roſe up haſtily, and went out, followed her, ſaying, ſhe goeth to the Grave to weep there.</hi> 32. <hi>When Mary was come where Jeſus was, and ſaw him, ſhe fell down at his feet, ſaying unto him, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</hi> 33. <hi>Jeſus ſaw her weeping.</hi> Can Brethren and Siſters that deſcended from the <hi>ſame Parents,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66385:15"/> that were bred in the <hi>ſame Womb,</hi> ſucked the <hi>ſame Breaſts,</hi> brought up together in the <hi>ſame Family,</hi> ſee any of them carried to the Grave before them, and not follow with weeping Eyes, and ſorrowful Hearts?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Miniſters heretofore have not died unla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, nor followed to their Graves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Weeping and Sorrow.</hi> They that <hi>watched</hi> over the People while they lived, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed by the People when they <hi>fell aſleep.</hi> When Death did tye their Tongues, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them; when the Seers eyes have been cloſed, and the feet of them that brought the glad tidings of Salvation to loſt Sinners, are fettered by the bands of Death, that they can come and bring no more: <hi>When</hi> they that brake the Bread of Life, became meat for Worms, and could pray with them, and for them, and preach to them no more; <hi>when</hi> they had done their work, <hi>then</hi> the Peoples ſorrows did begin. <hi>The children of Iſrael wept for Moſes thirty days,</hi> Deut. 34.8. And for <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 20.29. <hi>When all the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> When <hi>Samuel</hi> died, all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and lamented him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Stephen</hi> was not buried without much ſorrow, Acts 8.2. <hi>Devout men carried Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</hi> But <hi>now</hi> Miniſters Widows and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66385:15"/> Children might mourn, when many others are not concerned for them living or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Tho <hi>now</hi> in our Iron Age ſome can ſcarce ſorrow for departed Relations, yet in <hi>former times they have greatly mourned for ſervants that have died out of their Families. Deborah,</hi> that was <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s Nurſe, belonging to <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s houſe, had her Funeral attended with Tears, Gen. 53.8. <hi>Deborah, Rebecca</hi>'s <hi>nurſe, died, and ſhe was buried beneath Bethel under an oak; and the name of it was called Allon Buchuth, that is the oak of weeping;</hi> becauſe of the many Tears that were ſhed at her burial.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>compaſſionate Bowels, the troubled Heart, the weeping Eyes of our Lord Jeſus for a departed Believer,</hi> are ſignificant Indications of the Sorrow there ſhould be upon ſuch Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Divine Providence. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> wept; the <hi>Jews</hi> wept; and when <hi>Jeſus</hi> came after he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, he wept alſo; he was troubled with them that were troubled, and wept with them that wept for their dead, on which occaſion he was troubled, he groaned, he wept, <hi>John</hi> 11.33, 35.</p>
               <p>If all theſe did thus ſorrow fo <hi>their dead,</hi> may not we for ours? <hi>Dear Jeſus!</hi> when thou didſt not rebuke <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> weeping for their deceaſed Brother, but didſt weep with them; didſt not ſhew thine Anger, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66385:16"/> thy Pity to them in their Sorrow for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of a <hi>Brother</hi> from them; keep us that are concerned, becauſe afflicted, from <hi>ſinful Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and ſhew thy Compaſſion to us, whileſt we do caſe our burthened Hearts by venting of our Sorrow, and weeping out our Grief. Since we have ſo many approved Examples of Holy Men and Women that in the like caſe have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed in the like manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Defect of Sorrow, where there is true cauſe of Sorrow, is a falling ſhort of the exerciſe of thoſe Affections, which God himſelf hath implanted in our Hearts.</hi> Why hath God given us the Affection of <hi>Love,</hi> but that it may be ſet upon obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cts of Love? And the Affection of <hi>Delight and Joy,</hi> but that we may rejoyce when God affords us matter of Joy? And why the Affection of <hi>Grief and Sorrow,</hi> but that we ſhould duly grieve when his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with us call aloud, and provoke us to it? And if <hi>Loſſes</hi> are cauſes of, and calls to Sorrow; what <hi>greater loſs</hi> in things below, than the loſs of ſuch as ſhould be dearer to us than all things here below? Religion doth not deſtroy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but rectify it. Grace doth not aboliſh natural Affections, but directs them to their Objects, and keeps them in their due Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as they ſhould not be <hi>exceſſive,</hi> ſo not <hi>defective</hi> in their meaſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Love to, and delight in Relations while they live, must needs conſtrain our Sorrow
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66385:16"/> when by death removed from us.</hi> What is that which you <hi>truly and duly love,</hi> and delight in the enjoyment of, that you <hi>can forbear</hi> to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the loſs of? Nay, if it be unduly loved (as a worldly Man doth his Riches) when loſt, can ſorrow be concealed? And ſhall not <hi>we be allowed</hi> to love near Relations, more than worldly Riches, and <hi>ſo to ſorrow more</hi> for the loſs of the one, than of the other. I do know what it is to meet with loſſes of the World; but I do not know that they did break my Sleep; but I cannot deny, but my late loſs of one ſo near, hath kept mine Eyes waking in the deep ſilence of the Nights. How any ſhould have due <hi>due degrees of Love</hi> to Husband, Wife, Parents or Children while they live, and not have <hi>equal Sorrow</hi> for them when they dye, is not eaſy for me to give a rational Account of. For if the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the Object beget love to it, the <hi>Abſence</hi> of it excites deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; the loſs of it muſt fill us with Sorrow for it. <hi>Want of Sorrow,</hi> when they are taken from us, doth argue <hi>want of Love</hi> while they were continued with us. If you <hi>groan not at their Death,</hi> there is room for this queſtion; <hi>Were not you burdened with their Life?</hi> Did you look upon that Relation when alive, as one of <hi>your Enjoyments,</hi> when you do not look upon the Death of ſuch a one, as one of <hi>your Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> When Husband and Wife are known not to live in love, <hi>every one hath a Tongue</hi> to ſay,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66385:17"/> Such will not mourn for her Death. How ſhould he afflict his heart with Grief, when ſeparated by Death, when it was empty of Love when joyned in Life? <hi>David</hi>'s different Carriage at the death of his Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and of his young Child, doth not ſhew, that when he had ſo much Sorrow for the one, he had no Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the other, but that he had ſomething to moderate his ſorrow for the one, which he had not for the other; when he had hopes that the one was ſaved, and fears that the other was damned.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The want of lamentation and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a puniſhment that God inflicts upon Sinners at their Death.</hi> Job 27.13. <hi>This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppreſſors, which they ſhall receive of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> 15. <hi>Thoſe that remain of him ſhall be buried in death, and his widows ſhall not weep.</hi> That Husband was <hi>unkind,</hi> while he lived, or his Widow <hi>unnatural,</hi> that cannot weep when he is dead. Pſalm 78.64. <hi>Their prieſts fell by the ſword, and their widows made no lamentation.</hi> When God takes away his loving-kindneſs and Mercies from men for their great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while they live, as a token of his wrath, he will not have them lamented when they die, Jer. 16.3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the ſons, and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66385:17"/> them in this land.</hi> 4. <hi>They ſhall die of grievous deaths, they ſhall not be lamented, neither ſhall they be buried, but they ſhall be as dung upon the face of the earth, and they ſhall be conſumed by the ſword, and by the famine, and their carcaſes ſhall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beaſts of the earth.</hi> 5. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, Enter not into the houſe of mourning, neither go to lament, nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, ſaith the Lord, even loving-kindneſs and mercies.</hi> 6. <hi>Both the great and the ſmall ſhall die in this land, they ſhall not be buried, neither ſhall men lament for them, nor cut themſelves, nor make themſelves bald for them.</hi> 7. <hi>Neither ſhall men tear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither ſhall men give the cup of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to drink for their father, or their mother.</hi> Dying by Sword and Famine, denial of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, the Fleſh of the dead lying as Dung upon the Earth, devoured by the Beaſts, conſumed by the Fowls, <hi>and no Sorrow,</hi> no Lamentation for them, are Judgments of God upon wicked Men: And ſhould <hi>thoſe</hi> that dye in the Lord, be no more lamented, than thoſe that dye in their Sin, and for their Sin deſerve no Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Tho the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Carcaſe</hi> of the wicked rot in the Grave together, yet ſhould not the name of the righteous be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance? And can we remember their Name without Sorrow, that we have not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66385:18"/> their Preſence and Company, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of getting good by their Counſel and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forms uſual in Mourning</hi> for the dead; as, <hi>Ah my Brother,</hi> or <hi>ah my Siſter;</hi> My Wife; <hi>Ah my Husband;</hi> are foretold by God ſhould not be uſed concerning Perſons by Name, <hi>as a Judgment</hi> upon them for the wickedneſs of their Lives. As concerning <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> Jer. 22.17. <hi>Thine eyes, and thine heart are not but for thy covetouſneſs, and for to ſhed innocent blood, and for oppreſſion, and for violence to do it.</hi> 18. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thus ſaith the Lord concerning Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim, the ſon of Joſiah King of Judah, They ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah my brother, or Ah my ſiſter: they ſhall not lament for him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ah Lord, or Ah his glory</hi> [or Majeſty]. 19. <hi>He ſhall be buried with the burial of an aſs, drawn and caſt forth beyond the gates of Jeruſalem. Jehoram</hi> for his wickedneſs was puniſhed by God <hi>in his Life,</hi> his <hi>Perſon</hi> with an incurable diſeaſe in his Bowels, pained therewith for the ſpace of <hi>two years,</hi> at the end of which time, his Bowels fell out by reaſon of his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>at his Death,</hi> in his <hi>Name and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> in that the People made no burning for him, like the burning of his Father, that is, did not honour him at his burial, by burning of precious and ſweet-ſmelling Spices, as they did for <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 Chron. 16.14. But <hi>Jehoran de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted without being deſired.</hi> 2 Chron. 21.18,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66385:18"/> 19, 20. And ſhall <hi>thoſe</hi> that <hi>lived to</hi> the Lord, and <hi>died in</hi> the Lord, be no more ſorrowed for, than thoſe that lived and died in their Sin? Shall not leave be allowed that ſuch that were <hi>deſired in Life, might be lamented at their Death?</hi> Oh, let not that ſaying be uſed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſell aſleep in Jeſus, <hi>He, or She, lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſired, and died unlamented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Sorrowing and Lamentation for the death of others, hath been appointed and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in Honour to them in whom real good and worth was found while they lived. Jeroboam</hi> (his Child being ſick) ſends his Wife in a diſguiſe to the Prophet, to know what ſhould become of the Child; Who bid her return to her Houſe; and when her Feet entred into the the <hi>City,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Her Child ſhould die,</hi> and that <hi>all Iſrael ſhould mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam ſhall come to the grave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in him is found ſome good thing toward the Lord God of Iſrael, in the houſe of Jeroboam:</hi> The Child died, and they buried him, and <hi>all Iſrael mourned for him according to the Word of the Lord, which he ſpake by the hand of his ſervant Ahijah the Prophet,</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi> 14.12, 13, 17, 18. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was buried, and all <hi>Judah and Jeruſalem</hi> mourned for him, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lamented for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and <hi>all the ſinging men and ſinging wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpake of Joſiah in their lamentations, and made them an ordinance in Iſrael, and behold they are written in the Lamentations,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.24, 25.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66385:19"/> True and real goodneſs, the Image of God in <hi>meaner</hi> Perſons is precious and honourable, tho in Perſons of <hi>higher Rank</hi> is more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and might make them more uſeful while they live, and ſo the more lamented when they die; yet as Angels convoy the Souls of <hi>pooreſt Believers</hi> to Heaven, and ſhew their Love and Reſpect to them in conducting them thither; ſo thoſe that live, ſhould lament and ſorrow for the death of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill united to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>It is complained of by God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as an Evil, that Righteous Perſons ſhould be taken away by Death, and thoſe that live do not lay it to heart, Iſa.</hi> 57.1. And can it be laid to heart, without any ſorrow in the Heart? Some may ſorrow without Tears, but moſt ſhew the ſorrow abiding in their Hearts by the Tears running from their Eyes? Shall a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, an holy Woman be removed by Death, and lamented by none? Not by thoſe of the <hi>Family</hi> from whence they were taken? Lord, let not this complaint be made by thee, nor this charge brought againſt any of the Family more immediately concerned in thy late af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Providence that did befall all of them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>For my own ſake, and the ſake of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that when we hear, we <hi>may</hi> ſorrow, and Natural Affections ſpurs us on thereto, we <hi>may</hi> take heed of ſinning in our ſorrow, and may turn our <hi>Natural</hi> ſorrow to our <hi>Spiritual</hi> advantage; that <hi>in much ſorrow</hi> we might not be <hi>defective</hi> in our ſorrow, nor ſorrow with ſorrows diſpleaſing to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For your ſakes,</hi> becauſe our caſe will be ſhortly yours; and you may be to ſeek how to govern your ſorrows, as we are at preſent put to it to ſtudy and pray, how we ought to rule and manage ours. And <hi>for both you and us,</hi> becauſe it is a ſubject I have not read of, and I ſuppoſe, you ſeldom hear: The Theme of <hi>moderating</hi> our ſorrow for the dead is more uſual and ordinary, and an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:66385:20"/> for the comforting of the Living at the Burial of their Dead, is more frequent in Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Diſcourſes. And tho the Natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of many need rather a <hi>Bridle</hi> to hold them in, than a <hi>Spur</hi> to put them forwards, yet it cannot be denied, that ſome have ſo little ſenſe and feeling of the death of near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that they are a ſhame to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or if they do ſorrow and mourn, it is with a ſinful, paſſionate, vexatious, but not with a right and kindly ſorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> I. What are the Aggravations of defect or want of ſorrow for our Dead? In an Uſe of Reproof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> II. When is our ſorrowing for our Dead kindly and pleaſing unto God? and when turbulent Paſſion, a meer vexation of Spirit, and provoking to God? In an Uſe of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our ſelves concerning our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> III. When is our ſorrow Spiritually defective, when it is naturally abundant? Or when it is too little as we are Chriſtians, when it is never ſo much as we are Men? In an Uſe of Caution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> I. Tho ſome are to be blamed for ſorrowing <hi>too much</hi> for the dead, yet it cannot be denied but that there are thoſe that are <hi>weary of their Relations</hi> while they live, wiſh
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66385:20"/> they were dead, and rather <hi>pleaſe</hi> themſelves becauſe they are eaſed of them by death, than <hi>ſorrow</hi> becauſe they are dead. The death of a <hi>Child,</hi> of a <hi>Wife,</hi> of an <hi>Husband,</hi> of a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> is an heavy ſtroke; and as ſome lay it too much to heart, and mourn as if they had <hi>no Grace</hi> to moderate their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; ſo ſome make <hi>ſo light</hi> of it, as if they had no <hi>natural Affection</hi> to move them to mourn on ſuch a mournful occaſion. <hi>O Lord, are not thine Eyes upon the Truth? thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved,</hi> Jer. 5.3. <hi>Theſe turn not to the Lord that ſmiteth them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 9.13. But to prevent miſtakes, miſinterpretations and miſapplications, I judge it neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe theſe Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sorrow for the Dead, as ſuch, is no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace;</hi> nor <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and <hi>in it ſelf</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, acceptable unto God; becauſe it hath been, and may be in Heathens, as much as in Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this Diſcourſe, <hi>ſorrow for the Dead is not to be ſeparated from a ſenſe of Gods afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand,</hi> which ſhould be in Chriſtians more than in Heathens. A Sparrow falls not to the ground, nor a Body to the Grave without God's Hand, which we ſhould mind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Tho ſorrow for the Dead, as ſuch, be no Grace, yet it becometh Chriſtians, and ſhould be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66385:21"/> their care ſo to exerciſe their Grace in and about this ſorrow, that their ſorrow might not be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but pleaſing unto God.</hi> Many Graces in our ſorrow are to be drawn into Act, as our <hi>Faith and Hope</hi> concerning their Reſurrection to Eternal Glorious Life: <hi>Patience</hi> under his Rod, <hi>Love to God,</hi> tho he doth afflict us, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> God when he taketh from us, as well as when he giveth to us; and <hi>thankfulneſs</hi> to God for his Mercy and Grace to our departed Friends for their <hi>preparation</hi> for death, and his <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> in inabling them to conquer the fears of death, for the <hi>happy End</hi> that they did make, and <hi>rejoicing</hi> in God for the receiving of their Souls to the Manſions in our Fathers Houſe; ſorrow for the dead, that is no Grace, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Actings of theſe Graces, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by them, is more becoming Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than when it is alone, and ſeparated from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Tho Loſs of Relations befalls none but ſuch as have ſinned, and thereby made a forfeiture of their Lives; yet the death of Relations might not be inflicted for any Sin committed by the Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors beyond the Caſe of others that have their Relations yet continued with them. Job</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sons and three Daughters in <hi>one day</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by a ſtrange and ſudden Death, and yet he had this Teſtimony from God himſelf, that he was <hi>a perfect and an upright Man, and one that feared God,</hi> ſuch a one that there was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66385:21"/> nor ſuch another, <hi>Job</hi> 1.8, 18, 19. Tho we have many <hi>Humane Infirmities</hi> come to our Thoughts after their Death, which being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed, for Chriſts ſake ſhall be pardoned; yet when no Sin above Saints in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate, or no Conſcience-wounding, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin; or but what is common to the good, and is <hi>too often</hi> found in the beſt Men, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearch, under ſuch a Loſs, hath been committed by them when joined in Life, the Loſs is more eaſily born, than when ſome <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated</hi> Sin remembred, after they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by death, and proves the ſting of that Affliction. Therefore be adviſed, to live in Love with them, diſcharging <hi>carefully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly</hi> all Relative Duties in Life, that you may part with leſs <hi>ſtinging ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>more quieting comfort;</hi> whoever in the Family be firſt taken from the reſt by death. It will be no ſmall <hi>Comfort</hi> to the Surviving when the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation ſhall give them thanks for all their Love to them while they lived with them, and as great a <hi>Terrour</hi> to thoſe whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are not paſt feeling, if they leave a complaint behind them on a dying Bed; <hi>My Husband to me hath been a bitter Husband; or my Child to me hath been a diſobedient Child,</hi> and a grief unto my Heart; or if <hi>they</hi> do not, if an awakened, reflecting, accuſing <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth, will cauſe ſorrow at parting; and when their Bodies are conſuming in their Graves,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66385:22"/> will be filling and loading your Hearts with griping grief.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Perſons might be filled with ſorrow at the death of Relations, when it is not for their death, but for their own Self-intereſt in the World.</hi> As when a Man had an Hundred Pound <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> by the Life of his Wife, and loved the Eſtate more than her, doth ſorrow for the loſs of his Wife upon no other account, but becauſe by the loſs of her he loſt ſo much of the World. Such ſelfiſh ſorrow as this, is baſe, and might be in thoſe that have no right ſorrow for their dead.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sorrow for the Dead upon Spiritual Reaſons, becauſe we are deprived of the Spiritual Good, we might have got by their continued Life, or are made more uncapable of doing good by their death, tho it relate to our ſelves, is to be cheriſhed, but the want of ſuch ſorrow is to be reproved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Whether we ſorrow, or not ſorrow for our dead, is eaſily known by our ſelves.</hi> Such as do, need not apply this reproof to themſelves, nor be offended at it: Such as do not, ſhould take it to themſelves, for they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, tho they be offended. We muſt have the Tongue of Chriſtian Preachers, tho ſome Hearers have not the Natural Affections of Heathen men.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Whether the death of Relations be a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſome, or a Chaſtiſement to others that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main alive, a Penal Evil, or a Correcting, Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:66385:22"/> (ſince it is a Smarting) <hi>Rod, all ſhould have ſuch a ſenſe of Gods Hand, as to produce feeling ſorrow in their Hearts; want of ſorrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both, is a Sin thus aggravated.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>WAnt of ſorrow, and ſenſe of Gods Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Hand, is not Patience but Stupidity; not Submiſſion but Rebellion; not He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Fortitude of Mind, but a Sottiſhneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Is that <hi>Patience,</hi> when you feel no ſmart or ſuffering? Is that <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to his Will, when you have no feeling of his Rod? Is it <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient yielding</hi> to his Hand, when you have no ſenſe of the ſmart of the Rod that by his Hand is laid upon you? <hi>Submiſſion</hi> in <hi>this caſe</hi> hath theſe Requiſites in it. (1.) A <hi>deſire</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Relation, before it was taken from us. (2.) <hi>A thankfulneſs of Heart,</hi> if God would have continued the Relation to us.

(4.) <hi>A reckoning of all the Inconveniences,</hi> and diſcomfort of our Lives by their removal by Death; and yet, (5.) <hi>A quieting of our Hearts under God's dealings with us in taking them away from us;</hi> becauſe it was his Will in his Wiſdom ſo to do unto us. But if you did not <hi>deſire</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:66385:23"/> their continuance; but rather, for Carnal, Worldly, Selfiſh Ends, their removal; could not have been <hi>thankful</hi> for their Life, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly glad of their Death, ſtill for ſinful, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh Ends, have <hi>no ſenſe</hi> of the Loſs, nor did <hi>eſteem</hi> it a Loſs, but ſome Advantage, and pleaſe your ſelves with reckoning the <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> you have by their Death; will you blind the World, or your ſelves, by calling your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs of Gods Hand in their Death, a ſubmitting to the Hand and Will of God?

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66385:28"/> to God? And the more kindly your Sorrow is, the more your Heart will relent, and melt, and the more ſervent your Spirit in Prayer will be. While they were in their <hi>Health</hi> with you, it may be you tendered up <hi>Sick</hi> prayers to God; when they did <hi>live,</hi> your Prayers were <hi>dead,</hi> and dull, and ſlothful Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; when they were <hi>waking</hi> with you, you prayed with them in a drowſy, <hi>ſleepy</hi> manner; when God <hi>rouſed</hi> you by their Death, you prayed after with more Life; when they <hi>fell aſleep,</hi> God <hi>awaked</hi> you to more earneſt and importunate Pleadings with him at the Throne of Grace. If <hi>fear,</hi> leſt Mother and Children ſhould be put to death by <hi>Eſau,</hi> moved <hi>Jacob</hi> to mix his fearing and ſorrowing, with Prayer and Wreſtling; ſhould not <hi>feeling</hi> of the ſtroke of Death upon a <hi>Mother,</hi> a <hi>Wife,</hi> a <hi>Child,</hi> put us on to the like praying to, and pleading with God?

Some Perſons when one lieth dead in the Houſe, tho on a Lord's day will ſtay at home and weep, but not go out and worſhip God in Holy Duties; but when you have any dead, it is better drop your Tears into <hi>God's Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> than with them waſh your own <hi>Faces,</hi> or wet your <hi>Hankerchief</hi> from ſuch turbulent Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66385:29"/> I will ſhed my Tears for omiſſion of my Duty, for the good of the living Soul. That I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, nor did I pray with them, nor for them; did not teach them how to live, nor help them to prepare to die.</hi> When <hi>Nathan</hi> came to <hi>David,</hi> his Child died; when <hi>David</hi> was convinced of his Sin, for which his Child did dye, <hi>David</hi> turns his Sorrow for his dead Child, into Sorrow for his Sin; and laments, and weeps, and wails for the one, <hi>much more</hi> than for the other. Pſalm 51. <hi>Title and Pſalm compared.</hi> So you, <hi>Shall I lament my dead child, and not my dead heart? ſhall I ſhed tears becauſe it is under the power of natural Death, and have not I one tear to drop, becauſe my Soul is under the power of ſpiritual Death? Do I look upon its pale Face, and feel its cold Fleſh, and thereby pierce my ſelf through with many and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sorrows? And do I feel my own cold Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to God and Chriſt, and all that is good? Do I ſee the deformity of my Soul by reaſon of Sin, and am I more loathſome in the ſight of a pure and holy God, by reaſon of my ſin, and ſhall I be grieved more for the leſſer than the greater evil? Is it not ſin that hath captivated my Soul, worſe than Death that hath taken my Wife, or Husband, my Father and Mother, and carry them Priſoners to the Grave? O my Soul! correct thy Sorrow, and turn the ſtream of thy Tears into another Channel; abate thy Sorrow for the Dead, and increaſe thy Sorrow for thy Sin. If thou Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66385:30"/> never ſo much, thy Dead ſhall live here with thee no more; but if thou Sorrow not for thy Sin, thou muſt be ſhut out from living with God for evermore. Natural Sorrow had almoſt ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me up; and for want of Spiritual Sorrow I am in danger of being caſt down into Eternal Miſery. Therefore, tho I will ſorrow for my Dead, I will ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row more for my Sins: The loſs of God, and Chriſt, and Heaven by my Sin, will be a greater loſs, than the loſs of my deareſt Relation by Death, infinitely greater: The one by my Natural ſorrow cannot be recovered; the other by Penitent-goſpel-ſorrow may be prevented; therefore while I do the one, I will take ſpecial care that the other be not left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if your Sorrow be only turbulent Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you add ſin to ſin in your Sorrow. And inſtead of ſorrowing for former Sins, you will be falling into new, and ſorrow neither for new nor old. You will vent your Paſſion by the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Corruptions, ſaying, <hi>Oh, that I had never been born! Since my Relation is dead! Oh, that I might alſo dye!

               <q>When is our Sorrow for our Dead Spiritually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective tho it be naturally abundant? Or when is it too little, as we are Chriſtians, be it never ſo much as we are Men?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When we ſorrow for <hi>the breach of the Relation made by death,</hi> we ſorrow <hi>as men,</hi> tho in great abundance, for ſo an Heathen may do; but do <hi>not ſorrow for Sin as Sin,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God in the neglect of our Relative Duties while the Relation was continued, for ſo only Chriſtians can do. Tho our Natural Sorrow doth abound in the firſt reſpect, it is ſpiritually defective in the latter reſpect. Two things taken for granted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here it is taken for granted, <hi>That the moſt Loving Relations may Sin and fail in their Relative Duties one to another;</hi> for as much as we cannot yield perfect Obedience to any one of the Ten Commandments, among which the Fifth contains Relative Duties: And <hi>who can ſay,</hi> tho I have tranſgreſſed all the reſt, yet <hi>this</hi> I have perfectly fulfilled? I have heard that ſome have aſſerted, that they have lived Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Forty years in a Conjugal Relation <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66385:40"/> an angry word,</hi> or unkind act betwixt them; if ſo, might not we ſay, <hi>O peaceable Spirits that were in theſe! O rare Example, and ſeldom found!</hi> But be it ſo, is there no other Sin in theſe Relations but anger and angry words? What! Did they <hi>pray</hi> alſo daily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or <hi>as much</hi> one for another as they ought, and <hi>as fervently</hi> as they ſhould? Did they <hi>by all ways and means</hi> appointed by God help each other in their Spiritual Concerns as Duty did require? Were there never <hi>no ſinful Thoughts</hi> in their Minds one againſt another? there is one can tell you, <hi>his ſinful Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome Related to him, hath filled his Heart with more ſorrow, his Eyes with Tears, and his Mouth with ſecret Confeſſions to God, and coſt him more Sighs, and Sobs, and Groans in pleading for Pardon for the Sin of his Thoughts</hi> (tho re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted) <hi>than any angry Words or unkind Actions ever did.</hi> For the one might be more eaſily prevented than the other, becauſe we have a more abſolute government over our Tongues and Hands than over our Thoughts. What! Can any Perſons in any Relation ſuppoſe <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, Parents and Children</hi> ſay they did never Love <hi>too much,</hi> or at no time <hi>too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?</hi> never did take <hi>too much care,</hi> or never <hi>too little</hi> for their Relations, but had that juſt proportion and meaſure of Love to them and Care for them, as the perfect Rule requires: <hi>So much</hi> as God commanded, and <hi>no more</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66385:40"/> than God allowed? For my part, my Prayer ſhall be, <hi>Lord forgive my Relative Sins,</hi> whilſt others boaſt and bleſs themſelves, and ſay, <hi>O God, I thank thee I am not in this as other Men be, nor as this Man.</hi> And, <hi>Lord,</hi> let not me be as <hi>Blind</hi> as <hi>that Man,</hi> that can ſee no Relative Sins to confeſs to thee, or to be humbled for at thy Throne of Grace, when thou wilt find ſome to judge him for at the Bar of thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The reigning Sins, or Sins of Infirmities what they were, or are, in their kinds, degrees, frequency, and all Aggravations committed in our reſpective Relations, muſt be left to the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of every man's Conſcience, or to God,</hi> that was an Eye-witneſs, if Conſcience was fallen aſleep; and will be an Impartial Judge, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for the preſent perform not its Office of Witneſs, Accuſer, and Judge.</p>
               <p>Theſe being granted, that your <hi>Father or Mother, Husband or Wife, or Child</hi> is dead, you ſorrow and grieve, you weep and wall, you lament and mourn; there is <hi>your Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Natural Paſſion,</hi> becauſe your Relation is broke; but where is your <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in this ſorrow, when you had not one Tear (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many) for the <hi>Sins againſt God and them,</hi> while you ſtood in that Relation? And yet do not you ſee, while your natural ſorrow is abundant, your Spiritual ſorrow is defective, or none at all in this reſpect? Where are your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66385:41"/> 
                  <hi>Tears</hi> for your diſobedience to your Father or Mother when alive? Where is the <hi>Husband</hi>'s ſorrow for undue and unjuſt grieving of his Wife, ſadning her Heart, and ſending her by his unkindneſs to her Knees in ſecret to open her Caſe, and pour out her Tears and Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in Prayer? Did you <hi>without cauſe</hi> make her weep when alive, and ſhall not this in all your ſorrow for her when dead, make you ſorrow for ſinning againſt God and her before ſhe died? According as your <hi>Relative Sins</hi> were, more or leſs, greater or ſmaller, when the Relation held; it's time, <hi>it's high time</hi> to ſorrow for them, when by death it is broke; and ſo ſhew your ſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as well as a <hi>Man</hi> in ſorrowing for your dead. And do this <hi>now,</hi> if you have not hitherto; tho your Father or Mother, Husband or Wife, or Child, be long ſince dead and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into duſt, <hi>their rotted Fleſh and dry Bones, and bare Skull in the Grave do cry to God againſt you.</hi> Therefore while you ſorrow for their dead Bodies, ſorrow alſo for your own ſinful Souls, becauſe you ſinned ſo much againſt them in their Life-time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you mourn for the loſs of <hi>that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and delight that you had in loving of them, and in being beloved by them, be your Sorrow never ſo much, you ſorrow only as Men;</hi> for ſo an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then might do; but <hi>you ſorrow not for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God,</hi> by reaſon of thoſe Sins which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66385:41"/> Conſcience doth <hi>juſtly</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> charge you with, committed in that Relation; your Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is defective as you are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> You ſinned <hi>as</hi> you were an <hi>Husband,</hi> and for your ſin God was diſpleaſed; you ſinned <hi>as</hi> you were a <hi>Father,</hi> or a <hi>Mother,</hi> and God was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed for your Sin; you ſinned <hi>as</hi> you were a <hi>Son,</hi> or a <hi>Daughter,</hi> and for your Sin God was diſpleaſed; and God hath by Death taken away your <hi>Wife,</hi> your <hi>Child</hi> your <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Mother;</hi> you Sorrow becauſe they are dead, with great Sorrow, and herein you do no more, than a Man or Woman, as ſuch, might do; but you do not Sorrow that <hi>God is diſpleaſed,</hi> which is not ſo much as a Chriſtian ſhould do. You Sorrow, becauſe you are <hi>afflicted;</hi> but where is your Sorrow becauſe God <hi>is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</hi> You have many Tears for the loſs of your Creature-comforts, but have you drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped one for the loſs of that Comfort that ſhould ariſe from the ſenſe of the Love of God unto your Soul? You mourn for the <hi>ſmarting Rod</hi> that lies upon you; <hi>Nature, Fleſh, and Blood,</hi> will make you feel the ſmart, and cry out, becauſe of it, but you do not grieve; that by the <hi>Sin</hi> in your Relation, you grieved the Spirit of God; that <hi>Grace</hi> muſt inable you to do. Are not you herein like unto a Child that is ſcourged by his Father, he cries aloud, he weeps, and ſobs, he groans,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66385:42"/> but what is it for? Not becauſe his Father is diſpleaſed, this he is not troubled at, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſmart and pain that the Rod doth make him ſo ſenſible of. Do not you ſee, he doth not mourn <hi>as he is a Child,</hi> and ſtands in that Relation, but as he hath Fleſh that is pained by the ſtrokes? Might not he cry out under the Rod, and yet be a ſtubborn Child, a diſobedient Child, and not deſire his Father's love in the way of his Duty, nor lay to heart his Father's diſpleaſure for the Evil he hath done? Will you ask me, Sir, <hi>Are you ſure God is diſpleaſed with me, becauſe by Death he hath removed my Relation from me?</hi> I will ask you, <hi>Are you ſure that he is not?</hi> Which doth it look moſt like, Love or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure? And if you are not ſure he is not diſpleaſed with you under ſuch a Rod, ſhould not you ſorrow leſt he ſhould be diſpleaſed? Is the diſpleaſure of God ſo ſmall a thing in your Eye, that the fear of it ſhould not be ground of your Sorrow? And ſay, what if God ſhould be angry with me in what he hath taken from me? What if my Father ſhould be diſpleaſed, and the Death of this Relation be the fruit of it? Is not here ground to ſorrow as a Chriſtian, as well as a Man?</p>
               <p>The loſs of a <hi>good Husband, or Wife, Father, Mother, or Child,</hi> is a burden heavy to be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66385:42"/> born; but the loſs of the <hi>favour of God</hi> is greater, and his diſpleaſure preſſeth more hard upon a Soul ſenſible of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prays, <hi>O Lord, if thou rebuke me, let it not be in thine anger; if thou chaſten me, let it not be in thy ſore diſpleaſure,</hi> Pſalm 6.1. The loſs of a Relation is a Rebuke, it is a chaſtening, and it may be in anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; when it is ſo, Sorrow for God's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> as for your own Affliction <hi>as Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When you Sorrow more for the loſs of your Temporal Good by the Death of your Relation, than for the Spiritual Advantage you might have gained by the continuance of their Lives;</hi> You ſorrow too much as Men, but too li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You may ſorrow for the one, <hi>as well as</hi> for the other; but you ſhould not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſo much for the one, as for the other, becauſe the one is better than the other, and the loſs of the one a greater loſs than the other.

               <p n="4">

And yet have I ſo many Tears for the loſs of the leſſer, and not one for the loſs of the greater Good? Did I take the Creature for my God, that I ſorrow more for the loſs of it, than I do for the real loſs of him that is indeed the only True, Living and Eternal God?

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> THe Rules concerning the kinds and degrees of our Sorrow for the dead, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>Rule 1. <hi>Our Sorrow is not ſo much for the Death of a Stranger, as for the Death of a ſuitable and intimate Acquaintance.</hi> At the hearing of the Death of one, whom we had no Converſation with, we might entertain ſome Sorrow as he was <hi>one partaker</hi> of the ſame Humane Nature with us; as he was one that became <hi>liable to Death</hi> by the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> the common Parent of us all; as Death is a <hi>penal Evil</hi> upon Mankind, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring, and which God would not remit, nor except us from, when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Adam</hi> to an Account for the Sin he had committed; and <hi>as he had a Rational and Immortal Soul,</hi> that is paſſed into Eternity, tho we know not to what State in that Eternity.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:66385:49"/>
               <p>Rule 2. <hi>Our ſorrom is not uſually ſo much for an intimate Acquaintance when he dies, as for the death of Relations,</hi> excepr there be ſome other Circumſtances that might alter the Caſe. For an intimate Friend that dieth, the <hi>ſweet Converſe,</hi> the <hi>Affableneſs</hi> of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the <hi>Comfort</hi> in his Company, the <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> he hath done, might oblige me to mourn for an evil (as death is) that hath befallen him; for if it would have been matter of ſorrow to me to hear he was Sick, or caſt into Priſon, would not the ſame Principle and Love bind me to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when he is lodged in the Grave: But all theſe and ſuch like enumerated Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances there might be in a Relation; and <hi>beſides theſe,</hi> ſome nearer natural Obligation, as partakers of the ſame Fleſh and Blood, in a more immediate ſenſe than all Mankind in <hi>Adom</hi> were; and this might add degrees of ſorrow to what is the ſorrow for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friend when he dieth. For being nearer by Bonds of Nature to us, the greater the ſorrow when by death thoſe Bonds are broke aſunder.</p>
               <p>Rule 3. <hi>The nearer the Relation is, uſually the greater is our ſorrow for the breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by death:</hi> So ſorrow for thoſe that are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66385:49"/> near us by <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> ordinarily exceeds the ſorrow upon the account of meer <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.</hi> So alſo the ſorrow of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ren for the death of their Parents, being nearer in Blood, ariſeth to greater degrees, than that for others more remote. But the <hi>Conjugal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> being the neareſt, whereby <hi>two</hi> become <hi>one Fleſh,</hi> and breeds the ſtrongeſt Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the diſſolving thereof by death, begets, and feeds, and maintains the greater grief, pierceth deeper, and is more hardly born. For death cannot deprive us of a nearer Mercy than a part of our ſelves: As Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are by <hi>Multiplication,</hi> Husband and Wife (that walk ſuitably to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir relation) by ſuch an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that cannot be diſſolved but by death. Therefore that Relation that calls for the ſtrongeſt Love of all others, while it holds; the diſſolving of it calls for the greateſt ſorrow, when death doth cauſe it. If a Man muſt forſake his moſt Loving Father, and his moſt Tender Mother, to dwell with his Wife, becauſe of greater <hi>Love</hi> he ought to have to her, then he ſhould have greater <hi>ſorrow</hi> for the death of this Relation than for the death of Father or Mother. For proportionable to the Love and Joy in the Object injoyed muſt be our ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we are totally and finally deprived of it.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:66385:50"/>
               <p>Rule 4. <hi>The more perſons did anſwer the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of a Conjugal Relation in mutual, real, conſtant Love to, and care of each others Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and Spiritual, and Eternal Welfare, the greater degree of ſorrow as to the loſs of the Survivor there may and ought to be:</hi> Though theſe may part at death with greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, becauſe they filled up their Relation with Duty in time of Life. The more Fear and Love to God, the more Love and Care concerning their Relations, the more Conſcientious performance of Relative Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the more meekneſs of Spirit, the more kind Carriage and Sweetneſs of Temper and Diſpoſition, the moſt ſuitableneſs in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect there was in both, the more grievous the ſeparation by death to the Survivor muſt be: And who can forbear to ſorrow for ſo great a Loſs, when he doth ſit ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, and ponder deeply how great it is?</p>
               <p>Rule 5. <hi>A Wicked Husband that is a conſtant Curſe, and a daily Croſs unto his whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whoſe Wife is in a worſe condition for Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul, than if ſhe were a Widow, and whoſe Children by reaſon of his want of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, and Care for them, are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Ruine, than if they were Fatherleſs,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66385:50"/> leaves little reaſon behind him, why they ſhould grieve and ſorrow for his Death upon their own accounts.</hi> For <hi>who can</hi> ſorrow for a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from a daily Croſs? <hi>Who can</hi> grieve for being eaſed of a Burden under which they ſo long did groan? <hi>Who can</hi> ſorrow upon their <hi>own</hi> account that one is gone that did rather Hate than Love them, and filled their Hearts with daily ſorrow, their Eyes with flowing Tears, and their Mouths with Heart-piercing Complaints? And why ſhould any <hi>diſſemble ſorrow</hi> for ſuch, by whoſe Wickedneſs and Sin againſt God and the Family, God was diſhonoured and the Family ruined, when by death he is taken off from doing ſo upon Earth any more? Do you ask, who ever taught this Doctrine before? <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 27.13. <hi>This is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wicked Man with God, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage of Oppreſſors, which they ſhall receive of the Almighty.</hi> 15. <hi>Thoſe that remain of him ſhall be buried in death; and his Widows ſhall not weep.</hi> Were there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Rule 6. In mourning for ſuch Relations that <hi>neither did their Duty to God, nor to their Family, but lived to God's diſhonour and their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66385:51"/> grief, and died without Repentance for both, our ſorrow muſt be for their ſakes, and not our own:</hi> For the ungodly and unnatural, as dying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently in their Sins, and for the Loſs of their Souls, and Miſery in the other World, as <hi>David</hi> did for <hi>Abſolom;</hi> for tho our grief for them cannot mitigate their Torments, nor our Tears quench their Fire, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a grief to us, that our Relations ſhould live and die in their Rebellion againſt God, and neglect of their Duties towards us, but did diſhonour God whom they ſhould have glorified, and overthrew the Family by their Sin and Wicked Lives which they ſhould have built up and maintained: And as for their <hi>Sin</hi> while they lived, ſo dying impenitent for their <hi>Miſery</hi> after death. The death of ſome puts an end to thoſe Troubles, and Diſquiet, and Croſſes which they cauſed in their Families while they liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that for their <hi>own ſakes</hi> the Living can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find a reaſon why they ſhould mourn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are dead. But when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their death was the beginning of their Intolerable and Eternal Miſery, for <hi>their ſakes</hi> they cannot but give place to ſorrow: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or while theſe Thoughts are working, <hi>my Husband is dead, and his Soul is Damned;</hi> it will be hard to keep ſorrow from the Heart. And tho ſuch ſorrow doth not profit the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66385:51"/> Damned Soul, yet <hi>unaccountable</hi> ſorrow is not eaſily caſt off: Nor can we always ceaſe to ſorrow, when we cannot give a reaſon of any good that is the fruit of our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But yet a reaſon will be here ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, it was <hi>my Husband, or Wife, or Son, or Daughter</hi> that lived wickedly, and died impenitently; and the Soul of one <hi>ſo near</hi> is loſt, is for ever loſt. And <hi>Religion</hi> teaching us that the Souls of ſuch are miſerable, <hi>Nature</hi> will be working in us to lament their Miſery; and this is ſorrow for <hi>their ſakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rule 7. <hi>In mourning for thoſe that lived holily towards God, and Conſcientiouſly in their Relative Duties towards us, our ſorrow is for our own ſakes more than for theirs:</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying <hi>our Loſs is their Gain</hi> teacheth that the ſorrow is for the Loſer, and not for the Gainer: And indeed if we ſearch to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of our ſorrow, to find the reaſon of our ſorrow for thoſe that <hi>lived to the Lord, and died in the Lord, and after death do live gloriouſly and happily with the Lord;</hi> it will appear we are ſorrowing more for <hi>our ſelves</hi> than <hi>for them:</hi> We call it <hi>mourning for the dead,</hi> when it is indeed mourning <hi>for our ſelves yet living;</hi> for let us enquire,</p>

Do we mourn <hi>becauſe their Souls are perfectly Holy and Happy with God and Chriſt above?</hi> No, this is matter of our Comfort, Delight and Joy. Did not we earneſtly pray for them, <hi>ſick and well,</hi> that when they left Earth they might be received up to Heaven? And do we ſorrow that God heard our Prayers, and hath ſaved their Souls? Do we thus take on for this? Are our Tears ſhed becauſe God hath Crowned their Grace with Glory? Are we grieving on Earth becauſe they are rejoicing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Are we groaning here, becauſe they are triumphing there? For ſhame we cannot ſay, this is the reaſon and ground of our ſorrow, and that in this reſpect it is plain we do not ſorrow for their ſakes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do we mourn <hi>becauſe they are fallen aſleep in Jeſus? Becauſe they are gone to reſt in their Beds?</hi> Becauſe their Bodies in that ſtate in which they are, <hi>remain united to Chriſt?</hi> Are theſe grounds of ſorrow? Should we weep, and waſte our Tears becauſe theſe things are ſaid of them? Or is it not matter of Comfort and Joy unto us, that it is ſo well with their very Bodies, as theſe things declared by God himſelf do import unto us? Is it not better <hi>to die in Chriſt than to live in Sin?</hi> Is it not better to ſleep in Jeſus
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66385:52"/> than to be naturally awake, and ſpiritually aſleep in Sin? Is it not better for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lye ſtill, and reſt free from Actings of Sin, than to be able to walk in a conſtant courſe of wickedneſs? Is it not more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Comfort to have the Bodies of our Friends <hi>united</hi> to Chriſt in the Grave, than to have our Relations above ground <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from Chriſt, and not united to him? If it be, let us ceaſe <hi>over-ſorrowing</hi> for them with whom it is better, tho in the Grave, and begin to ſorrow for thoſe with whom it is worſe, tho they live with us. Which is matter of greater ſorrow, <hi>a departed Saint, or a living Sinner?</hi> And ſhall we drop more Tears for one departed Saint than for <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> living wicked Relations? Why ſo? When all theſe wicked ones are in danger of Hell, but the departed Saint is paſt that danger: The ungodly that do live are in danger of Eternal Torments both as to Body and Soul: The departed Saint is paſt the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both as to Body and Soul: For when the Soul is once ſafe in Heaven, the Body is for ever paſt all danger of Hell. Is this it that we ſorrow for? No verily, we do give thanks to God, that the Body is in theſe Circumſtances, though in the Grave.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Eight Queſtions propounded to ſuch who pierce themſelves through with almoſt-diſtracting ſorrow for thoſe that lived wickedly, and died impenitent.</head>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>DID you ſorrow for their Sin while they lived, as you do for their Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> (dying impenitently) <hi>now they are dead?</hi> Did you ſhed as many Tears for the one, as you do for the other? Did the one cauſe as deep abiding ſorrow in your Heart as the other doth? <hi>If it were ſo,</hi> your ſorrow for their Sin might aſſwage your ſorrow for their Damnation, becauſe you ſorrowed for the cauſe as well as for the effect: For <hi>that</hi> whereby they did diſhonour God, as well as for their Miſery that hath befallen them: <hi>If it were not ſo,</hi> what kind of ſorrow is this, that you ſorrow for the <hi>hurt</hi> of a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eature, and did not ſorrow for that <hi>diſhonour</hi> which that Creature did to God? What kind of ſorrow do you call <hi>that,</hi> wherein the <hi>Miſery</hi> of a Creature lyeth nearer to your Heart, than his <hi>Eclipſing</hi> and Clouding the <hi>Glory</hi> of God by his Sins, and Impenitency under
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66385:56"/> them, ever did in the time of his Life? Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by this ſorrow for the Creatures Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not for God's diſhonour by his Sin, which was in your Eyes and eſteem the greateſt evil, <hi>ſin againſt God, or the Creatures ſuffering for his Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>Did you do your Duty while they lived, to recover them from a ſtate of Sin, that they might have prevented this Damnation, you are now ſo ſorrowful, that by final impenitence and unbelief they are fallen into?</hi> Did you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly admoniſh them of their Duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for their Sin? Warn them of the Wrath to come? Tell them of their danger, the Extremity and Eternity of thoſe poſitive Torments, and the greatneſs of the Loſs of God, and all the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, their wilful ſinning did expoſe them to? Did you call them to Repentance, and ſhew them the neceſſity of forſaking Sin, and turning unto God, and of Faith in Chriſt, and ſincere Holineſs, that they might eſcape the Damnation of Hell, and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Eternal Glory in Heaven? And when you did not prevail with them, did you go to your Knees and pray <hi>to God, Lord change my Husbands Heart, convert and ſanctifie his Soul, that when he dies he might not be Damned? Lord, ſhew my Son his Sin
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66385:56"/> and Danger, convince him, melt and break his Heart for Sin; awaken his Conſcience, make him feel the burden of his Sin now, that he might not bear the heavy Load of thy powerful Wrath for ever: Tho he ſhould be Poor, yet let him not be wicked; if thou wilt not give him Riches, yet give him thy Grace; or if thou haſt given him the one, good Lord deny him not the other: Afflict him in this World rather than Damn him in the next: Deal as thou pleaſeſt with him in Temporals, but deny not my Prayer for him, for Special, Spiritual Grace, and for the Eternal Salvation of his Soul. If you did</hi> your Duty, <hi>you may have peace on Earth, tho he hath no reſt in Hell:</hi> And the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this may be your Comfort in your ſorrow. <hi>If you did not,</hi> it is ſafer for you to ſorrow <hi>that you ſinned,</hi> than that <hi>he is Damned;</hi> while you neglect to ſorrow for the neglect of your Duty in endeavouring to prevent his damnation. Sorrow for his Miſery will never help him out; but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſorrow for your own Sin is one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means to eſcape that Miſery you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he is in.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. Which is moſt fitting in your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Judgment, <hi>That God ſhould be juſt in the Damnation of an impenitent Sinner, tho he were your Relation; or that he ſhould deal
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66385:57"/> with his ſeparated Soul in a way of Mercy, contrary to his Truth, becauſe he was your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</hi> Is it not more ſitting that God ſhould puniſh him for ever for his ſinal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Q. 4. <hi>Is not God and Chriſt the only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Souls, infinitely more merciful than
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66385:57"/> you?</hi> And yet if the Father of Mercies, and the Saviour of Sinners do approve of the Damnation of your impenitent <hi>Husband,</hi> or <hi>Wiſe, Father,</hi> or <hi>Mother, Son,</hi> or <hi>Daughter,</hi> why ſhould you be filled with turbulent, diſquieting ſorrow? Should <hi>you</hi> appoint to him the <hi>meaſures</hi> of his Mercy, or the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> he ſhould ſhew it to? Doth he owe it to you or them, or any other? Is it not free, ſo that <hi>he may have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and Compaſſion on whom he will have Compaſſion? Rom.</hi> 9.15. May not God act <hi>as a juſt</hi> God, but you will ſorrow as if he were not <hi>a Merciful</hi> God?

And ſay, <hi>Will God ſhew Eternal Mercy to me, when he will pour out his Eternal Wrath upon my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, Brother or Siſter, Husband or Wife, or Child? What was I more than they, that they ſhould be Damned, and I ſhould be ſaved, after Death? Was not I equally invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Guilt of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Sin as they were? Was not I born a Child of Wrath as well as they? Was not my Heart as bad, my Sin as great, my Nature as corrupt as theirs was? Was not I as backward to good, as prone to evil as they were; and it may be more too? Should not I with others cry out and ſay,</hi> Eph. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us,</hi> (and me amongſt them) <hi>with ſpiritual bleſſings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in Chriſt? Should not I give thanks and praiſe to God for bleſſing me with ſuch bleſſings which tend to Eternal Glory, which Chriſt hath purchaſed, promiſed, prepared and poſſeſſed for me, tho others near to me are Curſed with an Everlaſting Curſe in Helliſh Places, juſtly inflicted on them for their Sin, and continuing finally Impenitent under the ſame?</hi> And can you be lifted up in ſuch high

               <p>Q. 6. <hi>Do not the Holy Angels and Bleſſed Saints above, know as much of the Torments of Hell, and of the Miſery of the Damned as you do, and yet are they filled with ſuch ſorrow becauſe of any being there, as you are?</hi> Do ſaved Souls above ſorrow there becauſe they do not find the Souls of others there whom they knew on Earth, and were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to, that died before them?

And will you pretend to be more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate and Merciful than Angels and Saints in a perfect ſtate of Bliſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</p>

               <p>Rule 10. <hi>Our ſorrow for the Death of Godly and Zealous Men that were in a Publick Station and Capacity admits of greater degrees
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66385:61"/> than ſorrow for our own Relations as private Perſons.</hi> Tho our ſorrow for theſe may be more <hi>ſenſitive and paſſionate,</hi> yet the ſorrow for the other may exceed in degrees, as more <hi>Judicious and Rational.</hi> Sorrow for Godly, Religious, Zealous <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> for Able, Holy and Laborious <hi>Miniſters</hi> when taken away by Death ſhould be more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and intenſive</hi> than for others that did only live a private Life; that is, there ſhould be more Mourners in number, and all theſe ſhould mourn with greater degrees (at leaſt) of <hi>Rational</hi> ſorrow for publick Perſons than for private. Thus all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> mourned for <hi>Joſiah</hi> with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great mourning, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.24, 25. When <hi>Samuel</hi> died, all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together and lamented him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.1. The hearing that a <hi>Miniſter is Sick,</hi> ſhould fill many Hearts with much ſorrow. The hearing that he is <hi>recovered</hi> is matter of Joy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.26, 27, 28. But the hearing that <hi>he is dead</hi> ſhould multiply the ſorrow of many. And there are great Reaſons of great ſorrow for the death of ſuch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Death of ſuch publick Perſons <hi>is a publick loſs.</hi> And the more general the loſs is, the more general the ſorrow ſhould be. When a <hi>private Perſon</hi> dieth that was

               <p n="2">2. The death of ſuch <hi>is a Spiritual Loſs.</hi> Can we ſorrow for the Temporal Loſſes that befall us by the death of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſhall we not ſorrow for our loſs in Spirituals by the death of ſuch that in their Life were helpers of our Souls in our way to Heaven?

Is a <hi>Spiritual Birth</hi> a greater Mercy than our <hi>Natural</hi> Birth, And ſhall our Natural Parents be lamented when they die, and no ſorrow for the other, when they can Preach to us, and Pray with us, and for us no more? How many Perſons may one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter inſtruct?

               <p n="3">3. <hi>By the Life and Labours of ſuch, the Kingdom of Sin and Satan is battered and ſhaken, and the Kingdom of Chriſt is encreaſed and carried on;</hi> therefore all that are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that the Devil's Kingdom ſhould be deſtroyed, and the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus ſhould be promoted and propagated, muſt be mourners, <hi>in Heart, tho not in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> at the death of thoſe that God did pleaſe to uſe for the one, and for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>Q. 9. <hi>Is not that ſorrow for your dead over-much, when it all runs out to them, that you are not ſenſible of, nor concerned for the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Church, nor Afflictions and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the People of God?</hi> All your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is contracted, and all your Tears run in this <hi>one</hi> Channel for your dead <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Mother, Husband, Wife,</hi> or <hi>Children;</hi> are not the Concerns of the Church of God <hi>greater</hi> than your Selfiſh Matters?

You are ready to die with grief for <hi>one Child.</hi> I will tell you of one that loſt <hi>two Sons</hi> in a Battel at once, when alſo the <hi>Ark</hi> of God was taken; and when he heard of the death of his <hi>two Sons</hi> he <hi>bore up,</hi> but as ſoon as mention was made of the taking of the <hi>Ark of God,</hi> he <hi>fell down and died.</hi> This was <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.17, 18. And his <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law that was with Child near to be Delivered, hearing that the Ark of God was taken, fell into Travail; the Women about her comforted her, ſaying, Thou haſt born a Son, but ſhe made them no anſwer, and regarded it not.</hi> She called the Childs Name <hi>Icha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bod,</hi> that is, <hi>Where is the Glory?

               <p>THE <hi>third Work</hi> we have to do, is to <hi>enquire after an effectual Remedy againſt exceſſive ſorrow for our dead.</hi> What is eaſie unto others might be hard to me in the <hi>practical</hi> part of this Inquiry. It is leſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preſcribe the Cure than to feel the powerful working of it. It is hard to have a due ſenſe of God's ſmarting Rod, and yet a patient ſubmiſſion to his Will. Man's Heart is either ſtony and ſtupid under Gods Afflicting Hand, and doth not feel it; or in the ſenſe of it doth murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine: Either when God ſmites we do not grieve <hi>at all,</hi> or if we are ſenſible of the Wound, do mourn <hi>too much.</hi> Both theſe Extreams have been already conſidered; now <hi>Lord direct me to the Golden Mean, and guide me to the middle way which lies betwixt theſe two Extreams, that I might grieve becauſe of thine Hand, and yet might not over-grieve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo heavy.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of exceſſive ſorrow for our dead will be the better found by finding out the <hi>cauſe</hi> thereof.

               </p>
               <p>The Helps againſt Immoderate Sorrow for our dead given in this Chapter might be reduced to theſe <hi>Four</hi> General Heads of Argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The conſideration of the ſtate of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of departed Believers.</hi> They are <hi>fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep;</hi> and if they ſleep in Jeſus (as they do, <hi>v.</hi> 14.) they ſhall do well.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Knowledge and Belief of the ſtate of the ſeparated Soul.</hi> Their Souls are with Chriſt Triumphant in Heaven, while their Bodies are ſleeping in the Grave; and theſe Souls he will bring back with him when he comes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The certainty of the Reſurrection of the Dead by the Re-union of the ſame Souls with the ſame Bodies,</hi> and ſo Chriſt will bring the entire Man with him at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus the Hope in the Text, is the Hope of the Reſurrection of the Dead, and confirmed by the next words.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Antecedent, Concomitant, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Circumſtances of the Reſurrection.</hi> That
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66385:75"/> is what ſhall go before, what ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and what ſhall follow after the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the dead; and all theſe are laid down in the following part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is <hi>a Spring and Fountain of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Lively Comfort againſt exceſſive ſorrow for the dead:</hi> And methinks I feel it already to begin to work: It warms my Heart, it doth begin to burn within my Breaſt: My Affections move, and it ſeems to me that my ſorrow is turning into joy, and my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs into rejoicing, and am put to a ſtand, whether now I ſhall call my Tears for my dead, <hi>Tears of Sorrow or of Joy.</hi> Have we been ſorrowing becauſe ſhe is dead? <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks</hi> I cannot but joy that <hi>ſhe ſleeps in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> Have we been mourning becauſe the <hi>Body is in the Grave?</hi> Oh how delightful is it to me to think upon ſuch good grounds, that <hi>the Precious and Immortal Soul is above in yonder glorious Heaven, in the preſence of the Father, and Redeemer, and Comforter, and in the innumerable company of Angels and ſaved Souls, perfectly Holy and Happy for ever?</hi> Have we been ſo much troubled becauſe the <hi>Body</hi> did fall at the <hi>parting ſtroke</hi> of death; <hi>methinks</hi> my trouble is allayed when I am conſidering and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſure that it <hi>ſhall riſe and fall no more;</hi> Is it an <hi>aggravating ſorrow</hi> to look <hi>back</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66385:75"/> the Circumſtances of the Funeral: The <hi>Bearers</hi> carrying the <hi>Corps</hi> upon their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the <hi>Mourning Relations</hi> following, and many <hi>ſorrowful ſympathizing Friends</hi> coming after to <hi>ſee</hi> the dead Body lodged in its <hi>long Home? Methinks</hi> another Affection is ready to take its turn, and to act its part, even <hi>Delight and Joy,</hi> when I look <hi>forward</hi> and foreſee <hi>the Lord a coming, and all his Holy Angels with him,</hi> calling the dead to riſe; they hear and come forth from their <hi>ſleeping places,</hi> and after Judgment go with their Lord into the higheſt Heavens, in Body and Soul, not only to their <hi>long,</hi> but <hi>laſt, yea, Everlaſting Home, to Live, and Love, and Joy in God</hi> to all Eternity. Oh what difference is there between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Thoughts of theſe great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous certain things, and thoſe that have been daily running to the Grave, looking upon a conſuming Body? What wrong have I done my ſelf in haſtening to this part no more, and coming to it no ſooner? Why have we been looking ſo long in the Grave, in which <hi>as ſuch</hi> we can ſee nothing but death, and cry out, as the Men to <hi>Eliſha</hi> concerning their deadly Pottage, <hi>O thou Man of God, there is death in the Pot,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.40. So we, <hi>there is death in the Grave.</hi> But when <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid, <hi>Then bring Meal, and

               <p>Concerning this repreſentation of death by <hi>ſleeping,</hi> four things may be premiſed as to this manner of Scripture expreſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Tho Beaſts do die, yet their death in Scripture</hi> (that I know of) <hi>is never called a Sleep;</hi> for they die to live no more. Death puts an end to their Life without a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to it any more. They are only in this World, and not to have Life in that World that Men are haſtening too. They are not capable here of <hi>Moral Government,</hi> of Sin or Grace, and ſo ſhall not be raiſed to undergo Eternal Puniſhments, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Eternal Rewards hereafter. Tho they do ſleep while they live, yet their death is not a ſleep, becauſe they ſhall die, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wake.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:66385:76"/>2. <hi>The death of ungodly Men is ſometimes in Scripture called a ſleep, tho more ſeldom.</hi> The worſt as well as the beſt, all Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day. As death is common to all, ſo ſhall the Reſurrection of the dead alſo be: Tho as there is a <hi>difference</hi> in their death, ſo ſhall there alſo be in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; but becauſe they ſhall awake, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them death alſo is a ſleep. Tho they had better to ſleep on, than to awake and riſe to be tormented. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the Earth ſhall awake, ſome to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is moſt frequently uſed concerning the death of holy and believing perſons,</hi> that they may familiarize it to themſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.24. <hi>When Chriſt ſaid our Friend Lazarus ſleepeth; the Diſciples thought he ſpake of his taking natural reſt in ſleep, but after explained his meaning, ſaying,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66385:77"/> he is dead, John</hi> 11.11, 12, 13. So <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Expreſſion of ſleeping in Jeſus is to be underſtood peculiarly of the death of true Believers that ſhall be awaked to live with him in Eternal Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15. Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Perſons go <hi>night after night</hi> to their Beds, and ſleep in their <hi>Sin,</hi> and at laſt die in their Sin. But it is peculiar to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Perſons to die in the Lord, and ſleep in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Carnal unbelieving Men might laugh this Doctrine to Scorn, as they did <hi>Jeſus</hi> that taught it, and ſay, <hi>We know that they are dead.</hi> And death is death whatſoever name you call it by; and what Comfort can we have from <hi>Words and Names</hi> againſt ſuch a real Evil as death is. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.49. <hi>Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Maſter.</hi> 52. <hi>And all wept and bewailed her, but he ſaid weep not, ſhe is not dead but ſleepeth.</hi> 53. <hi>And they laughed him to ſcorn, knowing that ſhe was dead.</hi> But ſince the moſt Wiſe and Ever-living God hath called death <hi>ſo often</hi> by ſuch a Name, there is <hi>ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Comfort</hi> in it againſt the <hi>fears</hi> of our o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66385:78"/> words yet in our Ears, <hi>You do not know what we do feel.</hi> All their weariſome days are now over, and their tedious nights are paſt and gone; there is no more wiſhing in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O that it were Morning;</hi> nor in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O that it were Evening:</hi> There is no more complaining, <hi>This Night is a long Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a painful Night; and this Day is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Day, becauſe it is a Day of ſo great and ſharp Affliction:</hi> Their Life is gone, and all their Sickneſs, Pain and bodily Griefs are all gone. As when a Perſon in his Sickneſs hath ſomething given him to cauſe him to ſleep, in his ſleep he is not ſenſible of his Sickneſs; ſo thoſe that are fallen aſleep, in that ſleep are no more ſenſible of ſuch Pains that with us they complained of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Death as a Sleep, yields us theſe Thoughts, that our Dead are freed from all worldly Cares, and piercing Sorrows thoſe Cares did bring along with them.</hi> If Perſons have had their Heads full of worldly Thoughts all the Day, and have buſied them in buying, and ſelling, and trading, in contriving and projecting for their worldly Intereſt and Advantage, yet when faſt aſleep in their Beds, they mind none of all theſe things; they matter not, nor do they regard what others awake are doing, nor whither they are going; nor the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they are taking, nor the Evil they are ſuffering, nor the Sin they are committing.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66385:78"/> All theſe things that took up their Thoughts when alive, they are freed from when fallen aſleep. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20. <hi>Behold I will gather thee to thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the Evil that I will bring upon this place:</hi> In this Sleep they are ſo quiet, that they do not ſo much as dream of any of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Death as a ſleep, tho it be a deep ſleep, helps us to the Thoughts how eaſie it will be for God to awaken them:</hi> They ſleep ſo faſt, that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power can raiſe them out of their ſleep, but it is more eaſie to Almighty Power to awaken thoſe that are ſleeping in their Graves, than for you to awaken one that is ſleeping in his Bed. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſleeping in his Grave, Chriſt gave a <hi>call,</hi> ſpoke the word, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> and he that was dead, came forth; and tho' he was <hi>bound hand and foot with Grave-cloaths,</hi> yet he came forth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.43, 44. So Chriſt with a word, with a call, waked <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his Daughter out of the ſleep of Death, <hi>Jeſus called, ſaying, Maid ariſe, and her Spirit came again, and ſhe aroſe ſtraightway,</hi> Luke 8.54, 55. So alſo the Son of the Widow of <hi>Naim,</hi> dead and carried out to be Buried, Chriſt did but <hi>touch the Bier, or Coffin,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Young man, I ſay to thee, ariſe, and he that was dead ſat up, and began to ſpeak.</hi> Luk 7.14, 15. If Death be a ſleep, this is our Comfort, it is eaſie for God to awaken them.</p>

And you are not troubled to lay your Child aſleep, when you have hopes and expectation it will wake again: When did you go to ſleep, without waking after ſleep? This Comfort, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Death doth bring unto us, that as we ſaw the time when ours fell aſleep, ſo there will be a Day when they ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake.</p>

When your Child complains he is not well, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to have him to Bed, and ſay, go to ſleep, <hi>You will be better after you have ſlept.</hi> Sure I am, theſe Bodies that are <hi>ſick,</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>weary,</hi> when they fall Aſleep in Jeſus will be wonderfully refreſhed, and be

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Death as a Sleep teacheth us, that it is no trouble to them that are in their Graves, that they do not know when they ſhall awake.</hi> Is this any trouble to a living Man faſt aſleep in his Bed, that he knows not when the day will dawn, and the Morning-light appear, and he awake? he ſleeps on, and concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with no ſuch Thoughts.

Chriſt in Heaven, and I with him! all theſe Angels in Heaven, and I with them! all theſe Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and happy, holy Souls in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and I with them! I ſee ſuch things I never ſaw, I hear ſuch things I never heard! I feel, I feel ſuch Love and Joy, that doth tranſcend all the thoughts I had of Heaven before I came into it. O happy day that I came hither! O joyful hour, I left my Body till it be raiſed, and partake with me in what I do enjoy! I am but newly come into this Glorious State, I am but now entred into this triumphant Society; and what praiſes are theſe? What Songs and Hallelujahs? what divine and heavenly melody do I hear?

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The Reſurrection of the Dead great ground of Comfort in our Sorrow for them: As alſo the Qualities and Endowments of their Bodies, when raiſed.</head>
               <p>THE Third Remedy againſt Exceſſive Sorrow for the Dead, is <hi>ſure knowledge, and firm belief of the Reſurrection unto Life:</hi> Death is oppoſed to Life, as being the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of it; the Reſurrection is oppoſed to Death, as being a <hi>reſtoration</hi> to Life: The one is the cauſe of our Sorrow, the other is a ſolid ground of Chriſtian Comfort. It is a Doctrine unknown by the Light of Nature, it is undeniably proved by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Heathens hearing <hi>Paul</hi> preach the Reſurrection of the Dead, did deride and mock, <hi>Act</hi> 17.32. for they did judge it a thing incredible, that the dead ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Act</hi> 26.8. This was the reaſon they ſorrowed for their de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſo immoderately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no hope that they ſhould live
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66385:84"/> again; and the Reſurrection and Chriſtian Hope are conjoyned, the one being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the other. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Of the hope and reſurrection of the dead, I am called into question.</hi> Act. 24.14. <hi>And have hope towards God, which they themſelves alſo allow, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> If the Reſurrection be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hope muſt be allowed, and the more hope of this, the more mitigation of ſorrow for the Dead, becauſe they ſhall live again.</p>
               <p>In this copious Subject, I muſt omit many things, and content my ſelf with ſo much as is ſufficient for my preſent deſign, which may be done in theſe two things: (1.) <hi>That there is ſufficient foundation for our Faith, that the Dead ſhall ſurely live again.</hi> (2.) <hi>That their Bodies for which we mourn, becauſe d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſhall not only be the ſame for ſubſtance, but in respect of Qualities, ſhall far exceed what they were while they lived, or when they dyed:</hi> And the Faith of this wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> be as much cauſe of Joy, as their Death was of Sorrow, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant.</p>
               <p>In the firſt of theſe, <hi>three</hi> things give me full ſatisfaction. 1. Taken <hi>from God.</hi> 2. <hi>From Chriſt.</hi> 3. <hi>The abſurdities</hi> that muſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow the denial of the Reſurrection of the Dead.</p>
               <p>Firſt in this Article of our Faith (from whence I check my Sorrow for the Dead,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66385:85"/> that it may be kept within bounds) three things in God, (ſo conſidered by us, tho one in him) remove my Doubts, confirm my Hopes in this Caſe: 1. The <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> 2. The <hi>Power.</hi> 3. The <hi>Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God being Infinite in <hi>Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> I am fully ſatisfied, <hi>that he knoweth the number of the dead, and where their Bodies were buried, or conſumed, and which are the bones and Skull, and Duſt of one, and which of another:</hi> for this is knowable in it ſelf, and therefore God knows theſe, and all other circumſtances of the Dead, or elſe his Knowledge would be limited and finite Knowledge, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to every thing that may be known, which is contrary to Natural Reaſon, to Scripture and Religion, and to the Infinite Perfection of the Divine Nature; to deny this Knowledge in God, is to Blaſpheme him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God being <hi>Infinite in Power,</hi> is able to raiſe all the Dead, all which, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of all of them being thus known to him; to raiſe the Dead is an Act of Power, and not of weakneſs, and is poſſible, and not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. Cannot the ſame Power that made all things out of nothing, cauſe theſe dead-out of ſomething to live again? Cannot the ſame Power that at firſt formed Mans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the duſt of the ground, and cauſed it to live, make theſe Bodies to live again, thô
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66385:85"/> they be turned into duſt? Cannot God do what he hath done? Cannot he do all that is poſſible to be done? Is not that which hath been done to ſome, poſſible to be done to others? Are there not many Examples in the Scripture that this hath been done? Have not many Dead been raiſed to Life? The Reſurrection of the Dead being in the rank of things poſſible, comes within the reach of Divine Almighty Power, which to deny is to blaſpheme, theſe two being manifeſt; to compleat the Argument, add,</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath declared his <hi>Will and Purpoſe</hi> that the Dead ſhall live again. We cannot argue from the <hi>Power</hi> of God, that a thing ſhall be, becauſe he is able to do it, becauſe he doth not will to do all that he can do; but we might argue from his <hi>Will,</hi> that what he doth will to do, ſhall be done, becauſe he hath Power to do whatſoever he will. Men might have a will to do ſome things, but they have not Power anſwerable to their Will, and they often would, but never can; but tho' God be not <hi>Omnivolent,</hi> to will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he can, yet he is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> to do whatſoever he will.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our reaſoning iſſueth in this, <hi>Whether it be the Will of God that the Dead ſhall be raiſed to life?</hi> The <hi>fundamental Error</hi> of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> denying the Reſurrection of the Dead, Chriſt ſhews was in their Ignoronce
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66385:86"/> of theſe two Principles, the <hi>Power and the Will of God,</hi> which is revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> The Scriptures do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in this, fully aſſuring us that it is his Will, that all the Dead ſhall be raiſed, the Wicked to Damnation, the Righteous to Life everlaſting: If you doubt, read theſe Texts, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth.</hi> 26. <hi>And thô after my skin, Worms deſtroy this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi> 27. <hi>Whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another, thô my reins be conſumed within me.</hi> Joh. 5.28. <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his voice.</hi> 29. <hi>And ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the Reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the Reſurrection of damnation.</hi> Joh. 6.38. <hi>For I came down from Heaven, not to do my own will, but the Will of him that ſent me.</hi> What's that? 39. <hi>And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</hi> Theſe are comfortable words of Chriſt to us: What a ſtrict Charge is here of the Father given to Chriſt! <hi>My Son, I give you ſo many men, and charge you with them, that you loſe not any one of them, but that you raiſe every one of them at the laſt day, and ſet them
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66385:86"/> before me in Body and Soul in my heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Do you fear, leſt among ſo many millions to be raiſed, any one of yours ſhould be left in the Grave, and never raiſed? Would not then ſuch be loſt? and is not that contrary to the Charge given to Chriſt? and contrary to the Fathers Will? Are not you ſatisfied that Chriſt hath, and will do his Father's Will in every Point? Hear his words: 40. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him, may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Are not you yet ſatisfied with theſe words of him that is able, and can, and faithful, and will, do what he ſaith, reaching to <hi>every one,</hi> without the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>any one?</hi> The Father that ſent me, hath declared his Will that I ſhould, and ſo I will raiſe every one of theſe at the laſt day. Believe, and ſorrow for your Dead with no <hi>more degrees of Sorrow</hi> than becometh one that doth believe that Chriſt will raiſe them up at the laſt day. <hi>John</hi> 11.24. <hi>Martha ſaid to him, I know that he ſhall riſe again, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at the laſt day:</hi> 25. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, I am the Reſurrection and the Life, he that believeth in me, thô he were dead, yet ſhall he live.</hi> John 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him: and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> 54. <hi>Whoſo eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66385:87"/> life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. throughout. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the Dead ſmall and great ſtand before God</hi> — 13. <hi>And the Sea gave up the dead which were in it, and Death and Hell</hi> [or the Grave] <hi>delivered up the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad which were in them.</hi> Now the Grave and Death hold your Relations that are under their Power faſt, ſo faſt that now there is no help, and you therefore ſorrow; but the day will come, when Death and the Grave ſhall deliver them up, and hold them no longer; here is matter of Hope, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not ſorrow as thoſe that have no Hope.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The indiſſoluble connexion betwixt the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and Believers that ſleep in him,</hi> may aſſuredly ſatisfie us, that ſuch ſhall alſo be raiſed. Firmly believe the one, and you cannot, or need not doubt of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Now if Chriſt be preached, that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you, that there is no Reſurrection of the dead.</hi> 13. <hi>But if there be no Reſurrection of the dead, then Chriſt is not riſen.</hi> 15. — <hi>Whom he raiſed not up, if ſo be the dead riſe not.</hi> 16. <hi>For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.14. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus dyed, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>groſs Abſurdities</hi> that unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably follow the denial of the Deads being
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66385:87"/> raiſed, may confirm us that they ſhall be raiſed. They are ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then Chriſt is not riſen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Chriſt be not riſen, and ſo the Dead ſhall not be raiſed, then Miniſters preaching, and Peoples believing is all in vain, <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then the Apoſtles were Liars, and falſe, for they affirmed both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.15. and in other Texts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then thoſe that are Dead in Chriſt, are periſhed, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then the beſt men are the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then a floodgate is opened to all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Gods People then are weakened for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuffering, <hi>v.</hi> 58.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Then Gods Covenant with his People is broke, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Beſides the certainty of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead, the conſideration of the <hi>Properties, Qualities and Endowments of their Bodies</hi> which ſhall ariſe, adminiſters more Comfort to us, and conſequently will be a further mitigation of our Sorrow. God hath not only <hi>aſſured</hi> us that theſe dry Bones, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed Bodies ſhall live, but alſo hath <hi>foretold</hi> us what manner of Bodies they then ſhall be, far more noble and excellent than when they lived or died.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:66385:88"/>1. <hi>They ſhall be raiſed Immortal and Incorruptible Bodies.</hi> While they lived with us they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mortal, and did admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Amen;</hi> ſo all theſe his Members ſhall ſay, <hi>We are they that live, and were dead, and behold we are alive for evermore. Amen. This is truth, ſo it is.</hi> When Death came in by Sin, all mankind became ſubject unto Death: When Sin was turned out by death, and theſe Bodies ſhall be raiſed, no more pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with it, they ſhall be as free from

Death did conquer them, and laid and kept them Priſoners in the Grave; but when they ſhall be raiſed to Life, and redeemed from the Grave, they ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſhall be raiſed powerful and impaſſible Bodies.</hi> While they lived here, they were weak and ſuffering Bodies, enduring hunger and cold, and thirſt; crying out of Pains and Sickneſs, or torments by Chollick, Gout and Stone, and Rheumatiſms, ſhaken by Agues, and ſcorched by Feavors, and ſwelling with Dropſie, torn with Coughs, overflowed with Catarrhs, and liable to hundreds of Diſeaſes, inſomuch that they died daily, yea died ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Deaths before they died, and many Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

Immortality of Bodies at the Reſurrection, to the Wicked is a Curſe and Plague, to the Godly it is a Bleſſing and a Favour conferred upon them, for tho' <hi>they were ſown in weakneſs, they ſhall be raiſed in power,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.43.</p>

Theſe Remedies for the aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our ſorrow, may be reduced to theſe five general Heads: But remember, it is not the bare Notion of them, nor curſory talking of them, nor ſuperficial thinking of them, but our ſerious pondering, and powerful, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Believing of them, and the Spirits effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al applying, and laying them warm to our Hearts, that muſt he the Cure to thoſe that are deeply ſorrowfull for their Dead.</p>

Say you ſo? weep not: for he HIMSELF will come, and he will ſurely have them forth. Did he at his firſt coming <hi>die</hi> for their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as well as for their Souls, and will he be content to have their Souls only with him in the Heavens, and their Bodies to lie always in the Grave? Did he <hi>purchaſe</hi> their Bodies as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66385:94"/> well as their Souls with the price of his own moſt precious Blood, and will he for ever loſe ſuch a part of his purchaſe? Are not the Bodies as well as the Souls of Believers <hi>Chriſts own</hi> by right of Redemption? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. and will he loſe his own ſo dearly bought for want of looking after them? Hath he redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from Sin and Hell, and will not he redeem them from the Grave?

Were they <hi>Sanctified</hi> in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as well as in their Souls and Spirits? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. and ſhall not their ſanctified Bodies be glorified Bodies at the coming of Chriſt? Did their Bodies <hi>partake</hi> with their Souls in the ſerving of their God, in Hearing, Praying, and Religious Faſting, and ſhall not they partake with the Souls in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Eternal Reward thro' the Riches
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66385:94"/> of his Grace? Did they <hi>preſent</hi> their Bodies (when alive) a Living Sacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto God, giving up their Bodies wholly to him, to do and ſuffer what he did call them to, tho' it were to Death? <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and will he ſuffer them to remain for ever as Priſoners of Death? and not call them from thence to be partakers of Eternal Life? Did <hi>both parts</hi> ſerve and yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, and ſhall <hi>one only</hi> be ſaved and rewarded by him? He was the Redeemer and Sanctifier of both, and he will be the Saviour of both: And if Angels ſent from Heaven cannot deliver them out of their Graves, he will come HIMSELF and bring them out. When he would redeem <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſent <hi>Moſes;</hi> but to Ranſom, Redeem, and ſet the Bodies of thoſe that died in him from the bonds of Death, with which they are tyed hand and foot, it being a Work too great for any meer Creature, he will come himſelf, and break theſe bonds, that tho' they be dead, yet they ſhall live. Chriſt will not ſtay, abide, nor reſt in Heaven, when the appointed Day is come, till he hath opened their Graves, and brought them forth. To the moderating of our Sorrow, theſe things concerning his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the Dead ſhall be raiſed, are the Ingredients whereof this Cordial is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <p>IS it nothing to aſſwage our Sorrow, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to conſider <hi>the Shout, the Summons, and Call</hi> that ſhall be given to the Dead, to awake, ariſe, and come forth of their Graves, and the <hi>Attendance and Miniſtration of the Glorious Angels, in reference to the Dead then raiſed?</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.16. <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a Shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.52. <hi>In a moment, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye, at the laſt Trump, (for the Trumpet ſhall ſound) and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible.</hi> What a potent Call, what a mighty Sound, what Almighty Power ſhall that be, which ſhall quicken all the Dead in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye? What is ſhorter than a moment? what is ſooner done than the twinkling of the Eye? and yet with ſuch quick diſpatch the Dead
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66385:97"/> ſhall be made to live, they are ſleeping in their Graves as before: Chriſt comes, the Trumpet ſounds; the Lord calls, the Dead ariſe; they all ſtart up, they all come forth, and look up, and ſee the Lord is come, and who it was that made them Live.

               <p>What this <hi>Shout,</hi> this <hi>Voice of the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and Trumpet of God</hi> ſhall be, is diverſly interpreted. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly ſignifieth ſuch Voices and Cries that Mariners uſe one to another, as a ſign when all ſhould put ſorth their Oars to row together; or of men heaving at ſome weighty burden, do uſe as a ſign when all ſhould heave together, and joyn their ſtrength together to lift it up: And then it is ſpoken after the manner of Men, for tho' the raiſing of all the Dead be a great Work, yet God will do it eaſily, and needs not the help and aſſiſtance of Angels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; or elſe to expreſs the Joy that the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe, and to increaſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66385:97"/> the Terrour of the Ungodly at that Day.</p>
               <p>The Trumpet at the Laſt Day that ſhall be ſounded in order to the raiſing of the dead, is <hi>three</hi> ways judged of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some apprehend it ſhall be a <hi>proper, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and material Trumpet, ſounded by Angels.</hi> Mat. 24.31. <hi>And he ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet.</hi> As when God came down to give the Law, there was <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings and Lightnings, and the Trumpet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Exod. 19.16, 18, 19. So when the Lord ſhall come down to raiſe the Dead, and to judge the impenitent Tranſgreſſors of his Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some underſtand it <hi>figuratively,</hi> alluding to the manner of Men, who ſound a Trumpet to gather Aſſemblies together. <hi>Num.</hi> 10.2. <hi>God spake to Moſes ſaying, make thee two Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of Silver —that thou mayeſt uſe them for the calling of the Aſſembly, and for the journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Camp.</hi> So when the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> came, the Trumpet of the Jubilee was to ſound throughout all the Land, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.9. The Day of the coming of Chriſt, and of the raiſing of them that ſleep in Jeſus, will be to all Believers their <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and the Trumpet ſhall ſound throughout all the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some conceive this laſt Trumpet <hi>ſhall be Chriſts own audible Voice,</hi> Calling and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Dead to ariſe, and come forth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66385:98"/> of their Graves. And they give theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>expreſs Letter of the Word.</hi> Joh. 5.28. <hi>The Hour is coming, when all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come forth.</hi> The Lord Jeſus ſhall utter his Voice, and the Dead ſhall hear it, and come at his Call.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>raiſing of particular dead ones, he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uſed his Voice.</hi> Luk. 7.14. <hi>And he ſaid, Young Man, I ſay unto thee, ariſe.</hi> Joh. 11.43. <hi>And he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus come forth.</hi> At the laſt day, when Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>Ariſe all ye dead, ariſe, come forth,</hi> they ſhall all hear, and come out of their Graves.</p>
               <p>But others ſay what the Sound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall be no man can tell, and ſo do not determine whether it ſhall be the one or the other, but ſay, <hi>The Lord himſelf coming down in his viſible Humanity from Heaven, ſhall call the World together, as men call Aſſemblies, by ſhout, by Voice, or by a Trumpet; ſo ſhall Chriſt by his unknown way, called the Voice of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, and the Trumpet of God.</hi> But when the Trumpet is ſounded, and the dead are raiſed, the holy Angels of God ſhall be employed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: For they do not only come along with Chriſt as his Attendants to ſet forth the Greatneſs of his Majeſty, as <hi>Lords, and Dukes, and Earls</hi> waiting upon an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King, but alſo to execute Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands concerning thoſe that ſhall be raiſed; for as they did attend them at their Death,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66385:98"/> and were the Convoy of their ſeparated Souls into the place of Reſt and Joy, ſo they ſhall alſo be ſerviceable to them at their Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Life.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>In gathering the Elect of God together.</hi> They died and were buried in diſtant places, far remote each from other, ſome in one part of the World, and ſome in another, and lie ſcattered far and near; but God ſhall uſe the Miniſtration of Angels to gather them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. <hi>And he ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from one end of the World to the other.</hi> If you have one godly Relation dieth in <hi>England,</hi> and another in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and another in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> trouble not your thoughts hereat, how ſhall they be brought together at laſt; if ſome die at one end of the World, and ſome at another, God by his Angels will find out where they were buried, and bring them together. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.27. <hi>And then ſhall he ſend his Angels, and ſhall gather his Elect together from the four Winds, from the uttermoſt part of the Earth, to the uttermoſt part of Heaven.</hi> None ſhall be loſt or left behind; this might be a ſtay and ſupport to ſome that are mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their dead Relations, with this Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, We know not where they died, nor where they were buried: Thô you do not, God will find them, tho they died in

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66385:99"/> ſhall not be one ſanctified Perſon left among the great multitudes of Impenitent ſinners that ſtand trembling to hear the Sentence of Condemnation to be paſt upon them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31. <hi>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the Throne of his Glory.</hi> 32. <hi>And before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd divideth his Sheep from his Goats.</hi> Weigh all this, and try what Comfort it will yield you. When you hear the Sound of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Bell, and what others may ring on the Funeral Day, the hearing of your Ear fills your Heart with Sorrow; think then that the <hi>Sound of the Trumpet</hi> ſhall be heard for the raiſing of thoſe that are lodging in the Duſt, and let that moderate your Grief, eſpecially when you conſider your Dead hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the one, and is not grieved at the ſound thereof; but <hi>He or She</hi> ſhall hear the other, and hearing rejoyce. When you ſee the <hi>common Bearers</hi> letting down their Corpſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in a <hi>common Burial-place,</hi> remember, tho the Wicked were laid on every ſide, yet when they ſhall be raiſed they ſhall be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and thoſe that ſlept in Jeſus ſhall all be ſet at his right Hand, without the mixture of one ungodly Perſon amongſt them all: And is it no Comfort to you, that yours ſhall be amongſt them?</p>

Ver. 15. <hi>For I ſay unto you by the Word of the Lord;</hi> that which I am to ſay, are not my words but the Lords: if I had not had it from him, I could have told no ſuch thing; <hi>that we that are alive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unto the Coming of the Lord, ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them that are aſleep.</hi> V. 16. <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> The like Order and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency he affirms 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. <hi>The dead ſhall be raiſed Incorruptible, and we</hi> (thoſe that ſhall be alive) <hi>ſhall be changed.</hi> We think that thoſe that ſhall be found alive, will have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage above thoſe that are dead. But they ſhall have this advantage above the <hi>then</hi> Living, that they ſhall be firſt raiſed, and be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, glorious and incorruptible Bodies <hi>ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and before</hi> thoſe that ſhall be alive: As they put off the mortal and corruptible Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſo they ſhall put on the Immortal and Incorruptibble Body, ſooner than they. Theſe died a Temporal Death, which the other ſhall not; but they ſhall live an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Life ſooner than thoſe that are not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66385:100"/> to die a Temporal death. The Living muſt wait for their Change, till thoſe that were changed from <hi>Life to Death,</hi> ſhall be again changed from <hi>Death to Life.</hi> Do you mourn becauſe your holy Relations are dead, and do not Live? Rejoyce alſo that they ſhall Live, and have the preeminence before thoſe that ſhall not die, but only be changed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath told you how mindfull and careful he will be of thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus: Forgotten by Men, remembred by God.</p>

Admit their Souls are now with Chriſt, yet their Bodies are not: It is but one part of them that now is Glorified; but the Day is coming, and it haſteneth, that all Believers, and <hi>all of every one,</hi> the Body as well as the Soul, ſhall be with the Lord.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66385:103"/> of time their Bodies are to remain in the Grave. While Children Live, we think how long is it ſince they were born?

Death comes and makes a Change, and ſnatcheth away the Children, and breaks the bond of Marriage, and then after a while the Enquiry is, How long hath my Child, or Husband, or Wife been dead? and theſe are <hi>ſorrowful Thoughts:</hi> But is there no Remedy, no relief againſt them? What if you ask, when our Dead that ſleep in Jeſus ſhall be raiſed, <hi>how long</hi> ſhall they be with the Lord? How long! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably longer than they ſhall be in the Grave. <hi>How long</hi> ſhall they be in the Grave? not for ever: Bleſſed be God, they ſhall not be there for ever. <hi>How long</hi> ſhall they be with the Lord? for Ever: Eternal thanks unto our God, they ſhall be with him for ever.</p>
               <p>But we ſit and think, it will be a long, a long, a very long time that they ſhall be in their Graves, and no man knows how long, and for this Sorrow fills our Hearts: Doth it? think again when they ſhall be raiſed. <hi>How long</hi> ſhall they be with the Lord? a long, a long, a very long, not time, but Eternity, and no Man can conceive how long it will be. And when you have thought of as many years
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66385:104"/> as you may imagine they may be in their Graves, all of them will not amount to ſo much as one hour, if compared with that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in which they ſhall be with the Lord.

               <p n="1">1 Queſt. <hi>If a particular Reſurrection now could be, as formerly hath been, would you deſire that your Relations that died in the Lord, might now be raiſed from the dead, to live and dwell with you in your Houſe upon Earth again?</hi> If it were <hi>poſſible,</hi> would you have your <hi>holy Father,</hi> or <hi>Mother, Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife</hi> raiſed as <hi>Jairus</hi> his Daughter, <hi>Lazarus, Tabitha,</hi> and others were; and come and ſit at your Table, and live with you in the ſame Circumſtances as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? <hi>If you would not,</hi> how unreaſonable is all your exceſſive Sorrow, becauſe they are dead, and yet would not have them live with you again, thô you may? What! will nothing content you? Is their reſtoration to Life now, no matter of your deſire, and yet is their death ſuch matter of ſo great abundant Sorrow? Will you be pleaſed neither way, concerning them <hi>dead or alive again? If you would deſire this,</hi> do you conſider what it is you do deſire, and how injurious you would be to them, that you may have your will, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66385:106"/> as you ſay the <hi>comfort</hi> that before you had in them? Tell me</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Would you indeed <hi>have them from the glorious preſence of God and Chriſt, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit to live with you?</hi> Could they have that Delight and Joy in your Company, as now they are filled with in the preſence of their glorious God and Redeemer?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Would you have them leave the Society of Angels and ſaved Souls above, to come and dwell among ſinfull men again?</hi>

               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Would you indeed</hi> have them return <hi>from Reſt to Trouble?</hi> from Joy to Sorrow? from Praiſing to Mourning?</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Now they have got out of the reach of Satans Temptations, would you have them live here again,</hi> to be buffeted again, and tempted and aſſaulted by that roaring Lion? And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have got the Victory, and won and wore the Crown, would you have them to come into the Field again, and conflict with the Powers of Darkneſs again?</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Were you <hi>grieved</hi> for them on their <hi>dying Beds,</hi> to ſee what they endured, and what cold Sweats the Pangs of Death did put them to? and yet would you have them <hi>live again,</hi> that they may <hi>die again?</hi> Do you ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that they have died once, and will you ſorrow on, except you could have them live again, that they may die twice? would you have them have two deaths for one? Is this your Love to them?</p>

               <p n="7">(7.) Would not you <hi>be more Kind to your ſelf and them,</hi> to prepare and deſire to go to them, than to have them return to you, if ſuch a thing could be? Do not you know which to chooſe, and yet ſorrow in this manner?</p>

               <p>DEad! Alas! wo is me! my Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead! my Wife, or Husband, or Child dead! can I with Comfort live? are not my comfortable days paſt and gone, when he or ſhe is dead and gone? Gone! no more to return to live with me on Earth! Let me look upon the Body in the Coffin, before it be lodged in the Grave, for after that I ſhall look upon it no more: mine Eyes ſhall ſee it no more. Look! behold its pale Face, its clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Eyes, its Jaws tyed and muffled up; theſe Eyes did ſee me, but now Death bath ſhut
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66385:113"/> them, that they cannot: This Tongue did uſe to talk with me to my great delight, but now Death hath tied it, and my Ears ſhall hear the ſound thereof no more: Theſe Feet did often walk with me, yea, we went to the Ordinances of God together, but now Death hath fettered them, that they can move no more; and muſt I follow it to the Grave, and ſee it covered with Earth, and there leave it? and when returned home, look for it at my Table, but it is not there; or in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but it is not there? The Cloaths the Body was often dreſſed with are there, but the Body is not there. Now it is ſo many Weeks ſince it was buried, ſhe is gone, but my Sorrow doth remain: Remain! it comes more and more, and doth increaſe: My Soul is grieved, my Heart is loaded, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit fails within me, the more I muſe, the more I Mourn; the more I think of mine thus captivated by Death, and buried out of my ſight, the more my Sorrow is renewed. Alas! I can contradict that Old Proverb, <hi>Out of Sight, out of Mind;</hi> for he, or ſhe hath been ſo long out of my ſight, but hath not been a a Day, or Night out of my mind; and the more and longer I remember, the more and longer I do ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Sayeſt thou thus, O my Soul? is it God or a Creature, the loſs of whom thou mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for? If of God, weep on, and Sorrow and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66385:113"/> ſeek him till thou findeſt him, for he is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Gracious God, and may be found: But if of a Creature, forbear thy Tears, and moderate thy Sorrow, for if thou ſhouldeſt weep thy ſelf blind, and break thine heart with grief, being dead and gone, cannot be any more found, wherever upon Earth thou ſeekeſt for it: Wilt thou then examine thy Sorrow, whether it be pleaſing unto God, or whether it be turbulent Paſſion, and meer fruitleſs Self-vexation? whether thou Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt like a Chriſtian, or an Heathen? whether thy ſorrow be not ſinful, and exceſſive, and therefore ſinful becauſe exceſſive? Doſt not thou know, haſt not thou read and learned, that thou ſhouldſt not ſorrow as thoſe do that have no Hope? are thy tears more boundleſs than the Ocean? for that hath bounds, and ſhall thy Tears have none? The Waves thereof go ſo far, and then are ſtay'd; and ſhall thy Tears continually drop, and have no limits ſet unto them? or wilt thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to run waſte, and ſhed enough to waſh thy Dead, when thou ſhouldſt keep them to pour out before God upon thy bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Knees, that by the Blood of Chriſt thy Sins might be waſh'd away? Have thy Tears ſo blear'd thine Eyes, or thy Sorrow ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd thy Reaſon, that thou canſt not ſee thy Sorrow to be Exceſſive Sorrow? and thy Grief to paſs all bounds of Chriſtian Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66385:114"/> Meaſure it by Reaſon and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And then tell me, O my Soul, if that Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be not Exceſſive for thy Dead, whereby thou haſteneſt the death of thy own Body, and inviteſt Death to lay it dead? Tho God by Death hath taken away the Life of thy Relation, yet hath he not commanded thee to uſe all means lawful, and to abſtain from all thoſe things (amongſt which Immoderate grief is one) that doth endanger thine own Life? and wilt thou thereby become guilty of thy own Death? Beſides, is not that Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row too much, that muſt be ſorrowed for? and thoſe Tears too many, that muſt be wept for? and more follow them, becauſe they are ſo many? Haſt thou Sorrow too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and muſt thou ſtill have more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt too much? Doſt thou not ſee what ſtraits thou bringeſt thy ſelf into, that while thou doſt abound in Sorrow, thou wanteſt Sorrow, becauſe as yet thou haſt not ſorrowed for this too much abundant Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?</p>
               <p>For give me an anſwer, O my Soul, if that be not too much abundant Sorrow, that doth more hurt than good? and would be too much if it were for thy Sin, which for Sin, tho the greateſt Evil, would be too much, when it doth more hurt than good? and doth it not do ſo, when it driveth to deſpair, keeps
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66385:114"/> off the Soul from Chriſt, and from hoping in his Merits, or God's Mercy: and is it not too much, when it is more for thy Dead than for thy Sin, for when thy Sorrow ſhould bear its proportion to the Evil thou ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for, and Sin is a greater Evil than the Death of thy neareſt Relation, be thou thy ſelf the Judge, if ſorrow for the leſſer evil be not too much, when it is more than that which thou haſt for the greateſt Evil?</p>
               <p>Moreover, O my Soul, wilt thou not grant, that Sorrow is exceſſive, which cauſeth thy Thoughts to run into the Grave, and hinders them from aſcending into Heaven? and to have many ſelf-piercing and ſelf-tormenting Thoughts of thy dead, for one ſerious and Heart-affecting Thought thou haſt of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Eternal God? and which makes thy Heart as cold in all thy Duties unto God, as the Body of thy dead Relation is in its Grave?</p>
               <p>Beſides, is not thy Sorrow too much, when it hinders thee from Spiritually rejoycing in God, and giving Thanks to him for all the Mercies, which in thy Sorrow thou doſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look? Eſpecially when let thy Condition be what it will as to Temporals, thou haſt much more cauſe to bleſs God for Spiritual and Eternal Mercies, than to grieve for the loſs of Temporals.</p>
               <p>Add to this, O my Soul, and then judge, that thou grieveſt ſo much for thy Dead,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66385:115"/> that thou haſt left off ſorrowing for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Church of God; and loſeſt much of thy little remaining Time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou haſt many Duties to perform, many Graces to get, and more degrees thereof, many ſins to mortifie and ſubdue, many Temptations to reſiſt, a deceitful Heart to watch and ſearch, Children and Servants to inſtruct and teach, and holy preparations to be made for Death, and another Eternal World, and while thou ſorroweſt, all theſe are neglected. Is it not too much?</p>
               <p>By this time, and from theſe Evidences, O my Soul, art thou not convinced that thy ſorrow for thy dead hath been, and ſtill is exceſſive ſorrow? that thou haſt and doſt tranſgreſs the bounds of Chriſtian Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereby offend thy holy Lord, wrong thy ſelf, diſcredit that Religion thou doſt profeſs, diſcourage the good, and caſt a ſtumbling-block in the way of the ungodly, and wilt thou ſtill proceed herein? Canſt not thou ſenſibly feel the ſtroke of his hand, and yet patiently ſubmit unto his will? How long wilt thou thus be caſt down, how long wilt thou thus be diſquieted within me? Is thy Relation fallen aſleep, and are thy Graces ſlumbering? Is thy Faith as dead in thy Heart, as thy Relation is in the Grave? Shall Nature wôrk thus ſtrongly in thee, and Graces ſo feebly? If natural Affections be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66385:115"/> exorbitant, hath not God implanted Grace in thee, that it may correct, moderate and govern them? Art thou only a Rational, and not a Believing Soul? Yea doſt thou thus Immoderately grieve, as if thou waſt neither believing, nor rational in thy ſorrow? If there be nothing in the common Book of corrupted Nature that thou canſt read, but what doth add grief unto thy grief, yet is there not enough in that ſpecial Book of ſacred Scripture that might turn thy ſorrow into Joy for thoſe of thine that ſleep in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? Or haſt thou thrown it by, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to look and ſearch into it? Or if thou readeſt, doſt thou underſtand what thou readeſt, or doſt thou conſider what thou doſt underſtand, or believe with an unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Faith what thou doſt conſider, whileſt thy ſorrow doth continue ſo exceſſive? Hath not God revealed therein ſuch <hi>certain Truths</hi> concerning the Bodies of thoſe that dye in the Lord, ſuch glorious things concerning their ſeparated Souls for the preſent, ſuch <hi>wonderful work</hi> that he will hereafter do, in reuniting the ſame Souls with the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in raiſing them from the dead, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming them from the Grave, ſuch <hi>deſirable Glory</hi> that their Souls and Bodies thus reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhall be joyntly partakers of, and be made perfectly and eternally holy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the enjoyment of the Father, Son, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66385:116"/> eternal Spirit, in the innumerable Company of glorious Angels, and the vaſt multitudes of ſuch as with them were choſen, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſanctified, and ſhall be for ever ſaved, ſinging triumphant <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> when they ſhall all be gathered together in the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence of their Lord and Saviour, and be poſſeſſed of thoſe Manſions in their Fathers Houſe, which were prepared for them? Hath he made known ſuch things as theſe, and are they ſure, and infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and yet for want of Faith, and Hope, and Love, doſt thou ſit here and ſigh and ſob, and grieve and groan, as thô thoſe thou mourneſt for, were for ever loſt, as if they were ſo dead, that they ſhould live no more? or as if they were ſo faſt bound in their Graves, that they never ſhould come forth, nor be taken from that dark place, to the Palace of glorious Light above?</p>
               <p>Attend then, O my Soul, unto the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherewith thy Lord doth repreſent the death of thy holy Relation now deceaſed, as a <hi>ſleeping in Jeſus.</hi> And if thou mourneſt becauſe ſhe is dead, yet try if thou canſt mourn becauſe ſhe ſleepeth in the Lord. For this doth Sorrow fill thine Heart? or mayeſt thou not rejoyce, that being dead ſhe ſo ſleepeth? for if ſhe ſleep in Jeſus, ſhall ſhe not do well? and if ſhe ſhall do well, ſhouldeſt thou not rather rejoyce, than thus lament
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66385:116"/> and grieve? When didſt thou ſorrow, when ſhe went to bed, and ſlept and took her natural Reſt? And now ſhe ſleeps in Jeſus, is ſhe not at reſt in her Grave, as in her bed, from all troubles from men, from Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pain, and from all Senſe thereof? from all worldly cares, and piercing Sorrows that did uſually accompany thoſe cares? and if her Death be but a Sleep, how eaſie is it for Almighty Power to awaken her out of her Sleep? And if ſhe ſleep, ſhe ſhall awake; for if in the uſual Courſe of Nature, waking followeth after ſleeping, wherefore doſt thou doubt, or ſear that Death being but a Sleep, that it will be a perpetual Sleep? And if ſhe went ſick, and weary, and weak to ſleep, when ſhe ſhall awake, ſhall ſhe not be more refreſhed, and revived in the Morning of the Reſurrection? If the time of her ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeemeth long to thee now waking, and not to her now ſleeping, why doſt thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf with that, with which ſhe is not at all concerned about? If in the time of her Life, thou ſaweſt her ſick, and could not ſleep, this was a grief and trouble to thee, would it not much more have added to thy ſorrow to ſee her languiſh, filled with pain, hear her ſigh, and ſob, and groan upon a ſick bed, and could neither recover, nor yet fall aſleep, and yet doſt thou take on that when by all means uſed, and learned, carefull, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66385:117"/> pious Phyſicians conſulted, ſhe could not be recovered, that now ſhe is fallen aſleep? Why doſt thou moleſt and trouble thy ſelf at the thoughts of the Length of her Sleep, when it is no more trouble nor diſquiet to her, than the Length of time is to one that is faſt ſleeping in his Bed, tho it may be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to one that ſitteth by, and waketh while he ſleepeth. Remember, O my Soul, and let the remembrance thereof aſſwage thy ſorrow, that it is her laſt, but not an everlaſting ſleep; tho it be long it ſhall not alwayes laſt, and becauſe it is a ſleep that is called Death, it ſhall be the <hi>laſt</hi> that ſhe ſhall ſleep, for when awaked ſhe ſhall ſleep no more for ever: And yet is this the Body that thou thus bewaileſt? and for this doſt thou thus Night after Night break thy ſleep? and when ſhe ſleepeth qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in the Lord, and dreameth not of any of the things that are done in this World, canſt not thou reſt nor ſleep in thy Bed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dreaming of her that is ſo unconcernedly ſleeping in the Bed of the Grave? Let her quiet and reſting Body rebuke, O my Soul, thy unquiet and reſtleſs thoughts.</p>
               <p>Moreover, conſider, O my Soul, whoſe State thou haſt more reaſon to lament and bewail, thine own, or the ſtate of the Soul of thy Relation that was converted and ſanctified, that did repent and believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death made the ſeparation betwixt thee
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66385:117"/> and her, or betwixt her Body and her Soul? Doſt thou not believe that her Soul being abſent from her Body, is now preſent with the Lord? and being ſo, is perfectly freed from all ſin, ſorrow, Temptation, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin, and from a poſſibility of ſinning? and is poſſeſſed of all good, filled with all Joy, perfect in the Knowledge of God and Chriſt, and in Love to, and Delight in all the Perſons in the (to us) unſearchable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Whileſt thou thy ſelf art grieving, groaning under the Burden of remaining ſins, conflicting with Satan and the Powers of Darkneſs, clogged with the Fleſh, and enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Allurements and Affrightments of this evil and deluding World? Thou in a ſtate imperfect and Militant, the Soul of thy Relation in a ſtate perfect and Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant? Is it not thy frequent Doubts and Fears whether thou loveſt God, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God loveth thee, with a differencing, ſpecial and peculiar Love?

That thy Sin had interpoſed betwixt thy God and thee, and cauſed him to hide his Face from thee? Were not theſe the Complaints alſo of thy Relation, while with thee, and didſt not thou endeavour to ſatisfie her grieved and diſconſolate Spirit, by reaſon of Gods fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent withdrawings from her Soul, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouredſt to reſolve her Doubts, to remove her Fears, and to anſwer all the Objections ſhe did make about the Sincerity of her Love to Chriſt? And is her ſeparated, ſaved, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Soul now above all theſe Doubts, and Fears, and Jealouſies? Is it now above Hope, and Deſire, becauſe poſſeſſed of what it hoped for, and deſired after? Is it now perfectly Loving, and delightfully Praiſing of its Lord and Saviour? Is it now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beholding of Him, and rejoycing in Him, and can doubt no more, and queſtion his Love to it, and its Love to Him no more for ever, becauſe it feels, and is filled with the lively ſenſe of both?

               <p>Lord, confirm my Faith in this, That as ſure as Chriſt is riſen from the dead, ſo ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall my dead, and all others be alſo raiſed: becauſe I read in thy holy Word, that if <hi>Chriſt be raiſed, then thoſe that ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides this, O my Soul, be further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and quieted within me, foraſmuch as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66385:120"/> thy Lord hath not only ſaid that thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus ſhall riſe again, but hath alſo foretold what Bodies they ſhall then be, tho the ſame for ſubſtance, yet their Properties, Qualities, and Endowments far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, than when they lived or died. Doſt thou ſorrow becauſe her Body was Mortal and did die? why doſt thou not rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall be raiſed Immortal, and then ſhall die no more? Art thou grieved at the remembrance of its weakneſs, ſickneſs and pains, why art thou not comforted at the believing Foreſight that it ſhall be raiſed a Powerful and Impaſſible Body, and ſhall be ſick and pained no more for ever? Or art thou caſt down becauſe that Natural Body by Food and Phyſick could no longer be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, nor maintained in Life?

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66385:120"/> Mould, and doſt not rejoyce, that the Soul already is made like to Chriſts Glorious Soul; and the day is coming, and it haſtens when the Body ſhall be faſhioned like to Chriſts glorious Body? Like to Chriſts Glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy! Lord, who that doth believe theſe words of thine, may not ceaſe to ſorrow in exceſs, becauſe now the Body is ſo like the duſt in which it lodgeth, and begin to joy, that in thine appointed time it ſhall be like the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body of an exalted Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Holy Lord! how great is the difference betwixt the ſame Man, as if he were not the ſame, when he looks upon his Dead with an Eye of Senſe, and Carnal Reaſon, and when with an Eye of Faith, according to thy Word? For when I ſit and muſe, and ſay, Methinks I ſee how the Body of my dead lyeth in the Grave, and how it mouldreth and conſumeth, I am a ſad and ſorrowful Man, and my Heart is grieved within me; but when I ſit and conſider, and believe, and ſay, Methinks I ſee it Redeemed from the Grave, methinks I ſee it raiſed an Immortal, Powerful, Spiritual, Beautiful, Glorious Body, ſhining as the Sun, and like to Chriſts Glorious Body, I am a chearful, joyful Man, and Comfort flows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly into my Soul.</p>
               <p>Moreover, O my Soul, thy Sorrow might be turned into Joy, when thou doſt believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, that rather than the Dead ſhould
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66385:121"/> always be captivated by Death, and ever held by the bonds thereof, the Lord HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF will come down from Heaven, and fetch them forth: Rejoyce, and be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, that when the appointed day is come, the Lord Jeſus will not ſtay, nor reſt in Heaven, till he hath opened their Graves, and delivered them from the Power of death. Bleſſed Jeſus! Help me to rejoyce in thy Mighty Power, and abundant Love, in that becauſe the raiſing of the Dead is a work too great for all the Angels in Heaven, thou wilt come thy ſelf, and cauſe them to live again. Methinks I hear thy Voice, <hi>Ye Dead ariſe;</hi> Methinks I hear the mighty Shout, and the Trumpet ſounding; methinks I ſee the Lord in his Glory coming down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and calling to the Dead, and methinks I ſee them in great numbers coming up out of their Graves: He calls, they tho dead do hear, and tho dead, at his Command do Live. Lord at thy pleaſure they fell into the Grave, and at thy Voice they do come forth. O powerful Voice! Oh joyful glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſight! Oh the difference betwixt a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Reſurrection day! the one was a ſorrowful, the other will be a joyful day.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially, O my Soul, when the day of Death was a parting day, the day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection will be a meeting day. Thou and thine at Death did part, and that did fill
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66385:121"/> thy Heart with ſorrow, but then thou and thine ſhall meet again, and never part. Thou and thine! that's not all, thou and thine ſhall meet the Lord in the Air. Wond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Once in the Grave, and after that with the Lord! A long time in the Grave, and after that long time is out, and over, be with the Lord for ever, which never will be out, and over! O bleſſed Day! O deſirable Day! Lord when ſhall it be? When ſhall it come? Dear Jeſus! gather in the choſen of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effectually, all the number that is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be with thee for ever, and then come, yea come quickly, that thoſe of thine that are ſleeping in their Graves may awake, and meet thee, and be with the Lord for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus, O my Soul, haſt thou followed thy Dead unto the Grave, and doſt know and believe that this Body ſhall riſe again, and be an happy and glorious Body, prepare to follow, ceaſe exceſſively to ſorrow, rejoyce in Hope that the Lord will come, when his ſhall be with him for ever.</p>
               <p>Be with with him for ever! Are they now
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66385:122"/> dead amongſt the Dead, and ſhall live with him for ever that doth live for ever? Is not this it that Chriſt did bleed, and ſweat, and ſuffer and die for? Is not this it that Chriſt did riſe from the dead for, that thoſe that ſleep in him might alſo riſe? Is not this it for which he aſcended to Heaven, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for them? Is not this it for which he intercedes, that all thoſe that the Father hath given him might be where he is, that they may behold his Glory? Is not this it for which he will come again, and take (the Quick and Dead in him) all of them unto himſelf, that where he is, there they might be alſo? Lord, haſt thou ſaid it, and ſhall I not believe it? Lord I believe, help thou my Unbelief.</p>
               <p>And doſt thou indeed believe theſe ſayings of thy Lord, O my Soul, and yet ſit ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing with exceſſive ſorrow for thy Dead, that ſhall ſo ſurely live, and be with him? Doth not ſome other Frame and Temper more become thee? Doſt thou believe the future happy State of their Bodies, whoſe preſent death thou doſt bewail, yet canſt thou not abate thy ſorrow? nor turn it yet into the actings of ſome other Affections, nor into the exerciſes of ſome Grace? which if thou doſt, will it not more tend to the Glory of God, to thine own Comfort, and to the Encouragement of thine own Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66385:122"/> which yet do live with thee, and to the ſetting off the Power of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when thou ſhalt believe the Promiſes and Principles thereof, and behave thy ſelf as one that is endued with ſuch Faith, and haſt ſuch firm Foundation for thy Faith?</p>
               <p>Bleſſed Lord, by thine aſſiſtance now I can, and by thy helping Spirit now I will endeavour that I might no longer ſorrow as if I had no hope, when the ſincere dying Chriſtian hath hope in his Death, and after he or ſhe is dead, the Living have ſuch grounds of hope that the Dead by Chriſt ſhall conquer Death, and that the day will come, when if they be looked for in the Grave, there they ſhall not be found, but may be ſaid, they are not here, but are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, come ſee the place where they did lye, but are not here, but gone to meet the Lord, and to be for ever with him in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
               <p>Then Lord, I will no longer droop, but hope. Awake my Hope, and let my Sorrow give place to thee. Hope! Oh how ſweet is this, how pleaſant and delightful? If my Sorrow was as bitter as Gall, this Hope is as ſweet as Honey: And this I do begin to feel, the more lively is my Hope of their joyful glorious Reſurrection, the more my Sorrow doth abate, tho now for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:66385:123"/> they be the captives of Death. Indeed had it not been that I had got this Hope, my Heart would break with Grief, but through Grace I have obtained this good hope, and by it my Spirit is revived, my Sorrow is more moderate.</p>
               <p>And having this Hope, my Sorrow is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into deſire, and longing for the Day and Coming of my Lord, that all that ſleep in Jeſus might awake, and their Immortal Souls be cloathed with Immortal, glorious Bodies: Oh how much better do I find it, to groan with deſires that they might live, and come up out of their Graves, than to groan thro grief that they are dead, and caſt into them? O Time, make haſte and flye with greater ſpeed, that this day of the Coming of the Lord, and riſing of the Dead may come! It is approaching, it is approaching, it is nearer by every Day, by every Night, by every Hour that comes and paſſeth away. As time doth wear away, ſo let my Sorrow, as to its exceſs wear off, and that by my deſiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſorrowing.</p>
               <p>Yet thou muſt wait patiently, O my Soul, tho thou doſt ſo earneſtly deſire it; and tho this Morning might not dawn before the night of Death doth overtake thy Body, yet wait while thy Life doth laſt, and leave thy Body, in hope that thine and theirs that be already
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66385:123"/> dead, ſhall ſurely live again in a Glorious, Bleſſed and Eternal Life: For doth the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman caſt his Seed into the Ground, and know that it ſhall rot, yet patiently wait till it riſe out of the Ground, and grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Harveſt, when it ſhall be gathered in with great advantage; and canſt not thou, O my Soul, be patient, and wait for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of thoſe Bodies, that are rotting in the Grave, till the Harveſt-day ſhall come, and they be gathered with ſo great Advantage into the Kingdom of their God?</p>
               <p>And while thou doſt deſire and wait, thou mighteſt alſo, O my Soul, rejoyce and be exceeding glad, becauſe that what thou wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for, and doſt deſire, thou haſt ſuch well-grounded Hopes, that it will ſurely be: And tho the Object of Deſire and Hope is good, as abſent, and the Object of Joy is good as preſent and enjoyed, yet let thy Faith make that as preſent which is yet to come, that thou mayeſt rejoyce therein, as if it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preſent.</p>
               <p>O Lord, notwithſtanding all my Sorrow, while my Faith and Hope were ſleeping, yet now by thy good Spirit of Grace they are awake: my Sorrow is turned into Joy; thou haſt put off my Sackcloth, thou haſt turned my Weeping into Hoping, Deſiring and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66385:124"/> Rejoycing in the firm Belief that my Dead ſhall riſe to Glorious Life; and being not ignorant of this, Lord pardon my Sin that hath been in my Sorrow, and let me ſorrow no more as one that hath no hope.</p>
